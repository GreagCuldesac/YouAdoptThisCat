<div id="chap2">
	<p> It’s a cheery bright day and you arrive at the address listed in the classifieds as simply “Apartment for Rent, Cheap, Nice cat.” You chuckle and figure, “How could there be anything wrong with that?”


You are Jane, a youthful and adventurous woman, and feel like taking the risk. Anything to get out of the city and away from its annoying people. The congestion, the fast paced frantic need to get here and there, and never feeling like you’ve accomplished anything. More specifically, you can’t stand to hear some of your relatives jabber on about things you should be doing. Its all nonsense to you, and you needed to get out. Now!


It’s a second, no, third floor apartment of a house whose style looks like a giant set of stairs, the apartment is the one at the top and you can get there from the three levels of whitewashed decks leading to its door. A variety of potted flowers dot each deck in several places. Some wrought iron work is used for hanging plants or the odd vintage signs for soda, cigarette ads, “Stay off the Grass.” and “No Smoking”.


The door looks antique, its thick curly textured glass obscuring what’s inside takes up a good third of the frame and the door handle appears to be brass but was painted over a few times by the white exterior paint used for the entire house. To the side of the door is a little flat metal silhouette of a cat playing with a ball of yarn.


If you reach down to pick up the metal cat, go to 3


If you decide to knock on the door first, go to 4</p>
</div>


<div id="chap3">
	<p> The little metal cat fascinates you, so before you knock on the door you pick up the flat metal cat in both hands, it feels heavier than you would expect it – WHAM! Something black in your periphery slammed into the glass from the inside, startling you.
You drop the little cat and clumsily try to set it back the way it was as a man’s agitated voice from inside yells. You can hear his feet pounding towards the door.
Just as the door swings quickly open, you whip your body upright and stare directly at him.


Next </p>
</div>

<div id="chap4">
	<p> The man at the door is an elderly Asian man with a worn tank top undershirt, and gray khaki pants. He has very little hair on his head and no facial hair.
He is also taking in your appearance, bright red sneakers and casual jeans, Ramones T-shirt, though from his body language you’d think he was looking beyond what he sees, peering into your soul.
You jokingly wonder if he’s going to teach you some kind of martial arts, not disrespecting his race, but more so that he carries himself in a manner an old wise man might in those movies. And right now, he looks a little apprehensive. You are like a student in his eyes.


“You come about apartment?” He asks in an immediate tone.
“Yes, I...Uh...Hi, how are you? I’m Jane.” And he invites you in quickly to have a look around. It’s a single bedroom apartment, simply furnished. The living room is big enough for a few people to lounge around in and the furniture is a very old style but clean aside from corners being scratched. The kitchen is nicely tiled with small white octagons and squares over the entire floor and a counter top curving around to the living room where two people could sit on stools by.


Walking over to the hallway you notice two doors, from the living room he says that’s the bathroom and single bedroom. His hands are on his waist. “Is this some kind of challenge?” You think to yourself.


You take the door on the left. Go to 5


You take the door on the right. Go to 6 </p>
</div>

<div id="chap5">
	<p> You see yourself!
Your reflection in the mirror of the bathroom’s medicine cabinet startled you there for second. It could be the bright red hair. This room has even more white octagon and square tiles and an old-fashioned wall mounted sink with metal bars to hang a hand towel are on either side. To the right of the sink about three feet away is a claw foot tub, which also serves as a shower. To your immediate right is the toilet and towel rack above. It’s small but functional, as it’s just you who will be living there.


The old man keeps it pretty clean, but he also knew you were coming, didn’t he?


Go to 7</p>
</div>

<div id="chap6">
	<p> You open up the door to bedroom. The floor has been carpeted unlike the rest of the apartment’s wood flooring and tile. Its cozy, the carpet feels new and soft. Windows bookend the bed and a single nightstand with lamp are to the right. As you walk in, to the left is a bureau and beyond it the closet. You check the view from the bedroom; through its lace curtains show a good deal of this side of the small town, trees interspersed throughout and more woods beyond. Just as you lean out some more you bump the nightstand and the windup alarm clock falls. It goes off and you reach down to stop it quickly.
As you stop it from ringing and pick it up, your face is right up against the puss of a big cat suddenly on the bed.
“Mow?” He says to you and purrs while rubbing his head on your nose before jumping away and into the hall.


You are pretty satisfied with the apartment; you can definitely imagine yourself relaxed and carefree here. But standing there musing all this you get the sensation that maybe you’ve spent enough time in what is still the old man’s bedroom.


Do you go check out the bathroom? If so, go to 5


If you’re sure it’s nice enough, go to 7 </p>
</div>

<div id="chap7">
	<p> Going back out into the hallway to the living room, you glance over the bedroom, its door left slightly open, and consider everything you’ve seen so far. “It’s very nice Mister uh?”
“Qiaokeli”. Thank you. I’ve had this for many years, since I was as old as you I think.”
He smiles now and you relax, hoping this means he’ll let you take over the apartment.
“I used to be the landlord of this building but I since sold it and became a tenant. I told the new landlord that I would personally take care of getting the new tenant and be sure they were right for the place. He explained everything about the rent before hand, you like, yes?”
“Yes I do, I can’t help but admire how nice you’ve kept everything down to the antique furniture.”
”It was new when I bought it!” He laughs quickly and you give him a polite chuckle.
“Now,” he says, “the apartment is furnished so all this staying. It’s yours if you want, including cat”, Reaching down to pull up the big purring black cat, which looks very happy to be held.
“Aww, well I…” and you start to wonder if you really should, and think about what it might entail in keeping him. Looking into his curious and gentle face you decide he’ll be good company and too cute. And it’s a free cat after all, “...ok!”


He hands you the paperwork, which he says, is just a formality around here. That much was true from what you’ve experienced so far. The current landlord practically ensured the apartment was yours over the phone. You just had to get the current tenant’s approval. You go over the other odds and ends and about the utilities and such as you fill it all out.


Once the paperwork is signed, he folds it up and stuffs it into his back pocket.
“I’ll take this down to Mr. Dan’s office. I’m all ready packed, so here’s the key.”
“My, this is all so fast. Thank you so much!” When you take the key, he also hands you the cat, which snuggles up to as best a cat can and looks at you.
“You will hold this cat, indoors only, yes?” You look into the eyes of the cat and get somewhat mesmerized. His face is perfect, almost like he’s smiling or at least saying, “There’s got to be some canned food around here yes?”


“All right”. And you give him a polite smile. Mister Qiaokeli gives a great sigh of relief and appears somewhat less energetic and older than he was a moment ago. He tells you to take care and goes out the door, closing it behind him. You sit down on one of the stools at the kitchen counter and in a few minutes you can see him from the window walking the sidewalk heading farther up the road. The road is perfectly straight towards the distant woods. He seems to be heading that way, and every once in a while he waves his arms frantically around him, as if there’s a bee or something attached. You look back at the cat still in your arms and shrug, and then look around.


NEXT</p>
</div>

<div id="chap8">
	<p> "Now what?” You ask yourself and the walls of the apartment, which are covered in wallpaper with an old repeating medallion pattern.
You counted on getting this apartment, brought everything you could and crammed it into your little car. Luckily it worked out so smoothly, a little odd too, but smoothly all the same. It still surprises you how fast it was, and you’re all moved in within a few hours of showing up to see it too.


Of your belongings were clothes and toiletries, a bag of paperbacks ready to burst, some odds and ends for around the house, the laptop for work, and linens. Not to mention your pal and indispensible appliance, the toaster.


Your new cat brushes past you and then starts bounding around the living room to the kitchen and back. “Well now Mister Cat…..”


You decide to pick up the cat and pet him a whole lot. NEXT.


Or maybe you need to get some food, especially a loaf of bread, found on 10</p>
</div>

<div id="chap9">
	<p> You pick up the cat and vigorously pet him, rub his belly, and a few noogies with a knuckle to the head, all of which he enjoys. His purring puts you into a relaxed state, letting your mind drift. But you figure that’ll be enough for now, being’s it’s nearly “Whaaa…?” You look at the clock and it’s been hours since you sat down! You were planning to get some shopping done as it’s not like Mr. Qiaokeli would leave any food in the fridge…or would he?


You open the fridge, and the smell knocks you out, falling back to the floor with a loud thud.
That’s how you imagined it anyway. You never can be sure what people leave behind but it’s actually fine. Inside is a clean empty jar that once was for jelly, half a loaf of bread, an unopened carton of orange juice, and some half eaten cat food. Looks fresh enough you think and slide the can out on the floor for him to gobble up. You check the cupboards and find there’s little left for your new cat to eat, let alone yourself.
Since its so late now, you decide to take a quick shower and go to bed. In the morning, you’ll have a fresh start and go shopping.


You change the sheets to the more festive linens you brought and dive into bed, finding it very comfortable. The cat nuzzles up next to you, putting its weight on your back. You can feel his purring resonate through your chest. He barely moves, as he must be asleep all ready. Must be nice for it to come on so quick you think, but as you start feeling warmer under the covers, the quiet room and the sweet fresh air pleases your senses, sleep comes quickly.




Go to 14.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap10">
	<p> You go to the door and the cat runs over and starts clawing at it. Remembering what the old man said you hesitate. However, this is your cat now. You live by a strict code, of not being so strict. You open the door and let the cat out. You watch him scamper around and play with all manner of things that fly or crawl by, chasing a leaf down the decks, leaping for it as the wind picks it up higher. In a new place, in a new town, with a cool breeze on a sunny day you feel as free as your cat is and half tempted to do the same thing.
You bat at a leaf that is twirling close by on the way down while a woman in a white jogging suit stops to greet you as you reach the sidewalk.
“Hello there. Do you live here?”
“Yes, just started today actually. I’m Jane.” You say jangling the keys around, keeping an eye on that leaf just above her head.
“I’m Harriett, pleasure to meet you! I’m always walking around out here. I make it a point to get in at least three to four miles a day. Its good exercise you know, keeps me healthy!”
“That’s great, you uh, look healthy.” You reply, trying to be friendly. She actually looks healthy enough to be walking around, still a bit pudgy in the middle. Might be more like one or two miles a week you think. She’s has a large build, and a face made up to show that she knows how to color things in. Not really a match for your more laid back jeans and tee or “whatever” style you’re so fond of.
“Thanks dear. Well, Mister Qiaokeli was a nice man, though you’d never see him ever since he brought that cat home one day. The poor dear was all soaked and looked near death. After that, you only saw him by the window holding the cat, just watching the world go by. I’d see him in the window and wave on one of my walks.” And gestures to the window, “I keep a strict schedule to stay healthy and strong. Can’t be one of those lazy lumps you know.” Which from her body language you take to mean everyone else in town and maybe you now. “You’re so right.” You say and straighten yourself up, showing off your fitness you think.  You tell her you have to get going. She gives you a quick “Well, bye!” with a smile and a wave, and power walks off down the street towards the middle of town, opposite in direction of where Mister Qiaokeli went.

You notice your cat has crossed the street, right where a row of quaint stores are, and waits. You snag the leaf mid-air, crush it triumphantly, and let it fall before heading over. You give the cat a pet, “guess you didn’t want to stay and chat with Harriett huh?” You’re right at the general store and to the left of it is a small grocery store. You see there’s a bunch of interesting items in the window and it reminds you of the thrift stores from when you were growing up, its full of old toys and other nostalgic items. You make a quick trip to the grocery and grab some items, and hustle back into Jones’ General. There’s even a bell attached to the door that jingles when you come in.

“Hi, is it all right if I leave my bag on this chair? It’s just groceries.” You ask, putting the bag down on the wooden chair by the door and coat stand.
“That’ll be fine.” The man says rather plainly, looking around and then to watch you browse. You find he has a good supply of everything you’d need around the house, but you’re more excited by the collection of old books that date back several decades. 

You grab a few that immediately catch your eye and they’re cheap enough. You check out the toys, which by today’s standards would be off the shelf so fast they might as well be explosives. While you continue to browse, you hear the sound of cans falling and claws skittering around. 
”Damn it!” the old man shouts as he chases your cat out the door with a broom.
“Hate cats!” he says and fixes his suspenders while you put your purchases on the wood counter. “Oh I’m sorry, that’s my cat. He must have sneaked in here.”
You look out the window and the cat is staring in the window at both of you, looking like he wants to come back in. “Did he damage anything? I’ll pay for it”. Already taking out your money for the books. “Nah, its fine!” You look over at the cans that were once stacked up neatly on top of an old wicker chest. He looks as well while packing your goods into a paper bag, “He was probably trying to get into my quilt chest. The smell of them must drive him nuts or something.”
“Are they very old?” You ask politely. “They aren’t for sale if that’s what you really mean, and I’m not going to be talked into it either.” He abruptly hands you the bag and slides the money off the table.  You give him a nod and leave with your bags.
Outside, your cat is cleaning itself on top of a bundle of newspapers yet to be sold.
A few people are around; a woman carrying a bag of groceries with both arms wrapped around it is heading your way and very little traffic.
“C’mon, um…” You realize you hadn’t given him a name yet. He doesn’t respond to “um” so that can’t be his name. You cross the street and reach into the bag. You shake the cat food box you bought at the grocers.


Saying “Snacks!” takes you to 13.


You try out a few other things. NEXT</p>
</div>

<div id="chap12">
	<p> “Hey Snacks! Kitty-Smacks? S-Max?”


The sound of shaking food gets some attention, but at the word “Max” his attention becomes intense and leaps out to the street quickly towards you. As if in unison, you notice the lady jumps sideways into the street with her groceries. A car screeches to halt but not before hitting the woman. You gasp and drop the box. The driver gets out and checks the woman as others rush over. The oranges from her bag roll across the street towards you, bumping off the curb and continuing down the road.
You watch for a little while as an ambulance eventually comes to pick her up and the driver files a report with the police. In a haze from shock and dismay, you replay the moment over and over in your head while the poor woman is loaded into the back of the ambulance and the driver and other eye witnesses circle around the activity. It was eerie, the look on her face seemed part deliberate and part surprise, almost as if she was…
The sound of the cat’s meow at your feet breaks your attention to the accident. Sadly you gather everything and head up into the apartment. There’s not much else you can do about it.


You haven’t even eaten since arriving, not even breakfast. You decide to start there.


Go to 14.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap13>
	<p> The fuss you’re making of jumping and waving various things slowly gets his attention, he wanders into the street. Suddenly, you notice that a car is coming up too fast right at him. You dart out into the street and lunge for your cat. Frightened, he dodges you, but the car doesn’t.


The first and last thing you feel is a sickening CRUNCH! The cat is fine by the way.


The End.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap14">
	<p> In the universe there are many constants that cannot be ignored. One is breakfast. Everything else is loosely bound to it in some way and what better way to be one with the cosmos than to eat part of it, preferably with jam or butter, or both.


You greet your toast making friend and pop in two slices for him to do his business while you pour a tall glass of orange juice and whip out the latest novel you’re burning through. With a polite ding, you’re informed he has done his duty and bear witness to the toasty perfection. “Nice job, keep up the good work.” You say, imagining the toaster being very proud of its self. You pull out the assorted jams you brought with you, and try a mix of raspberry and strawberry on one slice, and straight up peach jelly with the other. You don’t like peach very much, but you bought it and better to finish it off then to waste it. Showing him your toast, the cat seems to be more interested in the dry Kitty-Smacks cat food you found. If only he knew what he was missing. “Enjoying those Smacks, S-Max?” you say and he seems delighted. You decide Max is a good name for him.


A satisfying meal if you do say so yourself, and at the end of the chapter, you now look around to see what else you want to do. You look at the time. What? That can’t be right. Is it really…


11am? Go to 15.


4pm? Go to 18.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap15">
	<p> “Hmmm it’s early, not bad.  There is still plenty of daylight.” You put your things in order and head out, keeping the cat inside.  Reaching the bottom of the steps you see a woman strolling by quickly. “Morning Mister Jonesy!” she says exuberantly. “Harriett” the man in suspenders says so plainly, and with annoyance on his face, you’d think her cheery nature was hurting him. He returns to his business of straightening out the bundles of newspaper in front of his store window. The woman marches on in her bright jogging suit, looking around at everyone.
It’s a nice clear day and you decide to take a walk. The town’s buildings are mostly brick, the streets have old-fashioned street lamps along most main roads and businesses are normally packed close together. The neighborhood you’re in butts up to some. You can see as you walk down the streets that off the main road you’re on, the sidewalks end and the places are more rural and lead off to the woods beyond. When you were driving here, you passed by forest on both sides; it could surround it. You heard of a lake as well, but not sure where it is.


You’re walking around has only been through a small part of town, where to now?


You check out the town hall. Go to 16.


You head back past the stores on the way home. Go to 43.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap16">
	<p> You decide to take a quick jaunt down the main street that runs right by the town hall. It looks like they’re setting up for a party. The courtyard in front of the main building is being decorated and a stage is coming together. When you get closer to the edge of the activity, you’re next to a few men and a woman in business suits admiring the work and making comments about labor and expenses. The closest man is heavy set, clean-shaven, and his hair is a swept back look of gray and brown. He is very cheerful and “Don’t you think so?” he says to you while you were distracted with the festive operation.
“Huh? Oh I’m sorry, I didn’t catch what you were saying just then.” smiling politely.
“I was saying it was all coming together quite nicely for the town’s anniversary, don’t you think so?”
“I should say so; this will be my first time to see it.”
“Ah. Well. I’m John Gleenmore, the mayor. How do you do?” he puts out his hand and a warm smile. You accept his rather firm and vigorous handshake politely.
“I’m Jane, nice to meet you. So what can you tell me about the town?”
“It’s been home all my life. The town itself dates back about 200 years or so, when it was mostly for logging and the occasional group of nomads looking for some peace and quiet.
We may get less logging these days, but we still get the peace and quiet. We’re not the kind that go racing around, or stirring up unwanted activity at all hours of the night if you know what I mean.” You gulp noticeably. While thinking about the racer genes that tend to get you doing just that now and again, he smiles. After that there are only a few exchanges of small talk and he eventually is led back into a conversation with his colleagues. They then start to wander off towards the hall.
Mayor Gleenmore waves and says, “Nice to meet you. Enjoy your stay!” You wave back smiling, and his entourage return smiles to you in that way that is either sincere, or you expect because they have to. As you go back to watch the workers pull the stage together, a man comes up to you dressed in a brown suit wearing sunglasses. You assume he could be security or another town hall official.
“What are you doing here?” He asks without much expression.
“Oh nothing, just having a walk I guess. Is there a problem?”
“Not at all, just wondering if you could answer some questions for me?”
“Sure.” You say while you enjoy watching the stagehands sweat.


Go to 17.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap17">
	<p> “What would make someone follow a straight line?” is his first question. ”I dunno, someone who was looking down at it?” giving him a puzzled look then quickly glancing down to see if that’s happened to you without notice. You wonder if this is some kind of hidden camera show.
“I see. Do people seem to be more or less inclined to clip coupons these days?”
“Well, if they’re smart. I normally clip my toenails first, then coupons.” Smirking and glancing around, trying to notice a camouflaged boom mic or film crew. This might be a good place for it as everyone would be more interested in the decorating going on.
“How is it that many people think the same thing only when they’re in the company of others?”
“Mob rules I suppose. You get inspired or seduced by the activity and assimilate. Without taking a fresh look at it, you could be caught up in something you might not want. Ok what did I win??” You’re really anxious now, there’s got to be a reason behind these random questions.
“I’m sorry?” He says, grabbing his shades and polishing the lenses. Now he has the puzzled look.
”Why would you ask me all these odd questions then? I might as well ask you, why the people who eat rainbow snow cones insist on drinking the juice at the bottom, that stuff’s horrible!”
“I think they want to finish it, not lose out on any of the flavors they worked hard to get too.” He ponders his own answer, you can sense he’s applying it in another way, he then smiles. “You have a point, have a nice day.”
The man walks off. You watch him for a few seconds then go back to the sweaty workers.


Gary gets into his brown sedan and drives away, dialing up his office. An even toned voice on the other side comes through the speakerphone and asks him for a report.
“I don’t think there’s anything unusual going on, but I want to keep looking. There’s a new person in town that’s out of the norm. It might be a lead; you know how these things are.”
“I do.” Says the voice, “the Nexus could provide such an opportunity, what do you know so far?”
”She came from the apartments down the road from the town hall, across from the stores. Same one that old man who never leaves has recently left from.”
”It would be worth keeping an eye on her, and the old man.” He pauses, Gary can hear some rustling, obviously there’s a plan being put in action. He knows the Order too well. The slightest indication can lead to disastrous results, so they stay prepared. Another minute passes by till his mentor gets back on. ”How did the rest of the survey go”?
“Pretty well, the upcoming anniversary has the town buzzing, a few people could have been nicer, nothing I couldn’t handle.”
“Good work, I await future reports.”
“Thanks, signing off.”


Go to 59.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap18">
	<p> “Well that’s odd. I must have been more engrossed in my book than I thought!”
Putting down the book, you do a few things, eat and the odd chore for an hour or two, then head to the door. The cat looks up at you, as if asking to go out.” Why not, go Max, get that foliage!” and you let him dart out to play as you close the door behind you. You figure he’ll be back; he’s lived here longer than you have.
You hop in the car and drive around town to see what’s going on in town. You were planning that if nothing was open that you liked, that you might drive to the next town over and see if there’s anything going on there. Sometimes, nightlife in small town isn’t very lively at all. Its one of the few things you miss about the city. Something was always going on.

You spy an interesting shop that’s open and you park right out front, the coffee smell hits you right as you get out of the car. Inside, if there were one word to describe it, it’d be mocha.  The color scheme is like coffee with cream. A couple of two and four person tables with shiny tan tablecloths are here and there as you walk in, everything else is a dark walnut stained wood. The countertop is a black with a cloudy beige swirl running through it while the person standing around to serve you is dressed in a rich brown polo shirt with tan trim and matching visor. Ahead is a large chalkboard on a sandwich stand next to the counter with all kinds of flavored coffees.
A few pastries are on display on top of the counter. There is one customer in this small shop. A wavy haired guy dressed in a black dress shirt and jeans, reading the local paper and sipping his coffee from a bowl shaped mug.
At the counter the girl says, “Hi what can I get for you?” Quickly, you scan the flavors and decide on the Peanut Butter Cuppa. As you place your order you hear from the lone patron, “Oh that stuff is nasty, wouldn’t drink it myself.” He looks at you and you can’t tell whether he’s serious or not. “That bad huh?” you reply.
“So bad I’m on my second cup, that’s why you shouldn’t drink it, you’ll get hooked.” He cracks a slight smile at this and the girl hands you the coffee in an octagon mug. You pay and figure you’ll sit down with the guy. It would seem weird not to since you just started talking. “Sounds good to me”. You add your spoons of sugar and creamer, and sip the hot coffee. It IS really good. “So pretty cool that they give each one a different mug”, you say in an attempt to continue the conversation. He scans the paper and says, “Yah, I couldn’t buy the ones I wanted and just borrowed a bunch from friends and bought a few at the flea markets. I at least got the pretty lady behind the counter to wear a uniform.” To which he looks up past you and winks at the girl, to which she gives a nervous smile and glances away.
“No, I think it brings a lot of character to the place, makes each person feel like they got something unique and just for them.”
“Well thanks, that’s cool. I’m Joe by the way.”
“So it is really Joe Cuppa, like your sign out front?”
“Yah. Weird, huh? Just luck would have it I like coffee enough to want to open the shop.”
“Is it always this busy too?”
“Well some people don’t do much after work; they go home to their families. This does pretty well in the mornings and tapers off from there. It’s enough to get by so I’m content.”
“I’m just the opposite.”
”What, content?”
“Well, um, I mean that I’m more active and into coffee as it gets later. So I guess I taper backwards?”
“Maybe, but that just means there’ll be a bit more business from now on.”
“I’m all for that.” You say, smiling. Joe brushes off his side of the table with his newspaper now and crumples it. He quickly freezes and looks back up at you. “You didn’t want to read the paper did you?”
“Well I wouldn’t have minded, but it’s ok.” You tell him who you are and talk some more. He goes on about the neighborhood shops and you discuss your new apartment, cat, and freelance work until the coffee gets cold. You finish it off anyway and get up. He gets up too and walks over to the door, letting you out first. Standing there, taking in the night sky. It’s so clear. More stars than you can see in the city. “Do they only hang out above here?” amusing yourself with the thought.
“Next time, I’ll save the paper for you.” Joe says, interrupting your stargazing.
“Thanks!” Just then a low dark shape zips past Joe. You assume it was just the dark and lights playing with your vision at this late hour, but Joe stumbles towards you. You both catch each other, holding for a few seconds before you’re both standing on your own again.
“Well that wasn’t awkward, sorry Jane; something seemed to trip me there.”
”It’s ok.” You give him a smile and say goodbye. Heading back to the car, Max is sitting on it. “Well hello puss!” and you rub his head gently. “Did you want to go for a ride?”
You open the passenger door and he jumps down and inside quickly.
“Ah the infamous Max I presume, you think he followed your car all the way here?” Joe says, leaning in the doorway of his shop.
“I guess, maybe he smelled your coffee.” And you give him a final wave and get in the car. “Let’s drive around town a bit, ok Max?”
“M’ow?” says Max, for some reason he seems aware that you have the blood of racer in you, the look on his face expresses worry.
With a smile you speed off from your parking spot and head down the road. There is hardly anyone on the road, so this will be fun. This road leads down to the town hall, making a U that allows you to whip past it and opposite the park area they use for festivities to head back up the other side of the block. Max braces himself, feeling the pull of the turn. The tires screech around, then making a sharp right at the next intersection you head down another main road like the straight away of a racetrack.
This district has a few more stores for electrical and plumbing, records, “records?” you say in passing, and other odds and ends along with the Quilting Clubhouse situated by itself, a house converted to a business or meeting hall. Farther down is a statue of a man in what could be civil war attire on a pedestal in front of the local library. You pull in and circle it a few times for a better view and speed off. “I don’t know Max, they all look like General Custard to me…man, now I want ice cream.” Max is too busy trying to keep steady for an opinion. The businesses lend to neighborhoods with an abundance of trees and more ahead. You assume you’re near the end of the town limit or at least the developed area as you see park signs and the forest up ahead.
You decide that’s enough for tonight and head back around to take your tour a little slower, allowing Max to feel at ease and he pulls his front paws under to enjoy the ride in style.


He gets out on your side when you open the door. He races you up the stairs, winning the unspoken true ending of the race you just had. You let him in, and he checks out his food and water, and then scampers around the living room looking for stuff to play with.


You retire for the evening with tea and a book.


Early next morning you wake to the sound of sirens. You’re still dressed in last night’s clothes, falling asleep with the book at your side. You open the door and head down the stairs to see what’s going on. Max follows.


Police and Fire company vehicles race by as you reach a group at the bottom of the stairs. Harriett notices you and turns, shock and sadness clearly visible on her face.
“Oh my dear it was horrible! The Lackeys were at home sleeping when a burglar broke into their house and attacked them. He came right through the upstairs window. And to make it worse it was their neighbor! He denies it of course, saying he wouldn’t attack anyone, nor can’t explain how he got from his bedroom window to theirs, claiming to be asleep. But you don’t do all that by accident do you?” Harriett’s conversation was overheard by one of the others in the group and he joins in. “I never did trust that guy, always had an eye on Mrs. Lackey I hear.” He says, and then changes the subject, “They also had a fire down at the library too. I heard on the police band before going out. They don’t know how it started. They think the janitor was involved in it somehow. Thankfully, they got to it quick otherwise the whole place could have burnt down.”
Harriett then turns away from you to talk to the man, “Howard? I haven’t ever seen you around this way before.”
“I usually don’t, my normal route just takes me up by the park to the lake,” pointing up the street away from the town hall. “I found myself wanting to take a different route then followed the sound of the sirens and wound up here. Ran into Millie on the way, haven’t seen her in ages!” He chuckles and gets that far away look.
“I saw Mister Qiaokeli go up that way when I moved in,” You say, “Anything else up there?” Howard pauses to think, and rummages through his pockets nervously.
“Nope, just the park then the lake.” I don’t even think the buses go all the way up there.”
“Oh. That’s odd.” Harriett replies joining in.


Despite everyone’s lingering here and heading to the center of town, you head up the road to the park. You feel almost guilty about it the joy riding by the library last night. You saw nothing, but maybe you think you could have paid more attention. Now there’s attention to it, you could be questioned and you have nothing to say but “Well I was out racing around the library before it caught on fire.”</p>
</div>

<div id="chap21">
	<p> The park and the lake intrigue you, and are in walking distance. For you though, it could be miles and still be in walking distance. Harriett might have been stunned if you told her that. Oh the fitness rivalry there’d be! You chuckle to yourself.


Go to 22.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap22">
	<p> You leave Max behind to play or do whatever cats do secretly without you, and head towards the park. You go past a few blocks of neighborhood until you reach an overgrown meadow and a farm off on the left. At the end of the sidewalk there’s a statue of what you assume would be the founder of this town. It’s a bald man wearing glasses, in a suit, holding a book. You think it’s a law book but hope it’s really a horror novel. Just across the street is the wooded park and you think it may be about a quarter of a mile away to the lake.


The park is set up for a picnic type atmosphere. A gravel parking lot near by, then wooden tables scattered between the trees leaving the mowed open field of hills open for a Frisbee golf game or the traditional picnic with gingham blankets and a pack of ants to go with. The rest of the area is lined with trees, a few paths are marked with small wooden signs and you see the left side of the field curves a little the right. You walk the open field, taking in the blue sky and a few puffy clouds. Its warmer out now but you feel a cool breeze once in a while. You think about how much this is not the city. The most you could hope for is sitting out on some building’s roof, looking at the pollution or roasting on the blacktop. Most likely the roofs are off limits anyway and there’s the issue of never feeling like you can relax outdoors. You did like all the diversity, the foods, and the social events. That started to get overshadowed by the pace people kept. They’d literally run you over just to get to work; you found no point being so wound up over nothing of consequence like most of the 9-5 drones. So you’d never want to be around them, after a while it was just necessary to leave.
As you follow the curve of the field you notice straight ahead of you is another path, cleared to a point where a few people can walk together through the woods. The canopy of the trees covers the path and looks like it could be much cooler there so you decide to take it.
The path wanders slightly from side to side and gradually sloping upwards. At the end of the path, you see another field. Reaching it, the other side of the field simply drops off. You approach the edge and see the lake below. You have the strong urge to jump off the edge like a cliff-diver; the thrill is like leaning over a balcony in a tall building. You wonder if others feel like that, if it must be the sensation a skydiver feels. It is rather high up, but not impossible you think.


Do you go for it? Jump out to 76!


Or would you rather look around some more? Go to 23.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap23">
	<p> You don’t want to ruin your day by killing yourself, “all in good time” you remark.
Scanning the lake you see across to the other side where some small docks are that you assume are privately owned. There are no boats on the lake, only the birds are the most active at this time. Looking along visible edge on this side you see another clearing below and a person sitting there, it’s a little hard to make out but it could be a man in a white top at least. You head back down the path and follow the field down to the next clearing.


Reaching the clearing you don’t see anyone, but he might still be here. Either way, you head to the edge of the lake and take in its expansive tranquility. It would be a heck of a swim from where you were thinking about jumping in, let alone surviving, and toss a rock from the shore over in that direction. The water is nice and clear, you skim stones for a little while and think how cool it would be to get a boat and check out the entire lake some day.


“You like the apartment ok?” comes a strained voice from behind you. You turn around suddenly and see that the man you saw earlier was right behind you, but for how long?
He’s dressed in a dirty white tank top and gray khaki pants that have tears at the cuff. He has no shoes or socks on and it appears he used another white shirt to make a bandanna to cover his head.
“Mister Qiaokeli? I wondered what happened to you, are you ok?”


“Yes! I am living my final days here, I have lived long enough in care of the Fates. You should be home! Take care of the cat!” His voice strains, and he looks a little sickly.
“No, we should get you some help! What is all this about?”
“I…” He says, gripping his chest. “Last night I have been pulled all over the forest, into and off of trees and into the damn river. People have come here without knowing why, and I have had strange dreams….And I have lost my shoes. I never do that!”
You look down. What you thought were shoes were merely very muddy feet.


“Ok…that’s strange, but Mister Qiaokeli, I don’t see why….”


“I found this cat here; he was wet and smelled horrible. I think he swam across the lake. When I took him home I had cared for him day and night and fed him soft food, water, and buttermilk. His health returned. One day he regained his strength but became frightened, looked into my eyes. I felt burned by them, and I knew what he was. He is no cat! He is the hand of fate touching our lives, like kitten with string of yarn he pulls on them, makes people’s lives change.” You start to smile but his serious gaze has not changed, only intensified. “I’ve seen it, I let him out by accident once. Many people suffered and I lost a dear friend. You keep him close, care for him, he will stay inside with you and everyone will be safe. My string must be very tight if he’s able to affect me.” He summons his strength and straightens up to make his point. “ If he is out, there will be death!” Mister Qiaokeli, losing his will, slumps over and sits by the lake, exhausted. “I am done, you must take my place.” These are his final words. Now he sits there facing the lake. He doesn’t move.

You walk away slowly; tears are in your eyes for feeling sorry for him. But can it be true?


You think it’s the ramblings of a tired old man, perhaps losing his mind. 
Go to 25.


If you really take this to heart, race home now. Go to 56.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap25">
	<p> The walk back is emotionally and physically exhausting, you’ll be glad to get back home. The activity seems to have died down and only a few cars pass by. The typical farmer in his pickup, cars here and there, then, a brown sedan with tinted windows drifts by quietly. You find it a little out of place, but whatever, it could have been the Mayor’s.


When you near your neighborhood you see flyers stapled to the telephone polls. There’s a number at the bottom with an address:


CRIME RUNNING RAMPANT IN OUR TOWN!!


Our peaceful town is now a travesty of its former glory.
A neighborhood watch is being formed, don’t let crimes go unpunished!
Burglary, theft, vandalism, arson.  You can’t even trust your neighbors!
Can you simply stand by and let this happen?
Meeting to be held at the Quilting Clubhouse at 8pm to discuss action and report any suspicious activity or persons.
Ask Harriett Wynne for details.


JOIN US, TAKE ACTION, DON’T BE A VICTIM!

You’re a little put off by this. You support the neighborhood watch idea, but not when it sounds a little too extreme. So one night of random vandalism and suddenly the town goes bonkers? If this were the city, you’d hear this on the news daily. Perhaps this isn’t the norm for them here. You’re thankful but the idea of Harriett burning you at the stake for hot-rodding around the town one night is now stuck in your head. You don’t know whether to laugh or be worried that it might come true.


When you get home, you check up on Max who also meets you at home. “Hello there puss!” as you let him in. He immediately heads over to the kitchen. You can tell he wants some Kitty Smacks and so you pour him a bowl. You imagine how simple it would be if you could just pour yourself a bowl of it too and be content as well.
It’d save time, no extra dishes, and only one box of food to buy for both of you…
You shake your head quickly, that would mean not having toast, what were you thinking?!
To rectify the thought process, you have some toast, butter, straight up. You keep an eye on the clock as you two dine and carry on till later.


It’s nearly 8pm now. You leave Max in the apartment and head out. Deciding to walk, by the time you reach the clubhouse there’s a small group gathered around the outside. It seems the activities are in full swing. Harriett is at the top of the steps with a megaphone, the police are parked out front, watching, and one of them is at Harriett’s side.
“Thank you all for coming; it’s a relief to know so many of you are truly concerned about the welfare of our town and willing to do something about it.”
There’s mix of emotions, stragglers like you in the back are still on the fence about her intentions.
“The officers here will be taking down your names from our list, we’ll be able to call them in if we see anything suspicious to report on our patrols.”
From what you gather, most are very excited about it, still more are signing up. The ones closest to Harriett are older women, probably from the quilting club, and appear to be scanning the crowd, already looking for potential troublemakers.
“Can anyone say witch hunt?” you catch yourself quickly hoping it wasn’t that loud. You didn’t expect to blurt it out but there it went.
“You can say that again.” As you turn, holding your mouth shut you see its Joe Cuppa smiling at you.
“Mmmph…I mean, hey Joe. What’s going on?”
“Dunno, saw the flyers and thought I’d watch the radical militia form, seems rather tame unfortunately.”
“Yah, and I was going to dust off my beret. That’s standard militant wear where I come from.”
“And where did you come from again? Pre-21st century Cuba?” He chuckles.
“Um, yah…” you say and look at him with a manic stare, pretending you’re serious.
Joe nods ahead, “Looks like they’re going back in, we should check it out.”
“Yah, maybe they have food!” You both watch the crowd separate into those going home and the ones going in which you follow. The cops are leaving the festivities to the new watch.


Inside the Quilting Clubhouse smells a bit stale. Quilts hang on every wall to display their club’s quilting prowess. There’s one or two that are pretty thick. You wouldn’t mind snagging those. They’re probably very comfy to sleep while wrapped inside.


You both spot the big bowl of trail mix and hang out in the darker part of the back munching as the crowd moves into the center of the room with Harriett making a gathering motion.


“All right, now we can get down to business!” She does a quick scan of the room, she doesn’t appear to catch you or Joe, takes out a clipboard and continues.
“This neighborhood watch meeting has started, does anyone have any questions or concerns?” No one comes forward so Harriett continues. ”Well I’d like to thank everyone for volunteering. I know some of you are really concerned for what has happened, and I’ll make sure something gets done about it.” She then looks at the clipboard to read the agenda. “First off, I’d like to talk about Mr. Lackey’s neighbor, he’s been released and I don’t think that’s right. I don’t see why you’d let someone like that go.” There’s a brief murmur that he was found in the Lackey’s bedroom in his pajamas. “We should keep an eye on him. Anyone who’d like to volunteer to watch him please let me know. From what I understand he hasn’t spent much time getting to know the neighbors so this could be an opportunity”, Harriett makes a small note on that item with a check.
“Secondly, if any of you have information regarding the fire, please inform me. I can take down your statements and forward them on to the authorities. The janitor says he’s innocent. That remains to be seen.” No one comments, she looks back down and makes a note of it.
“Thirdly, I don’t know if any of you met our newest arrival to our town. Her name’s Jane, and she now lives in Mr. Qiaokeli’s apartment with his cat.” Harriett pauses to gauge the crowd. No reaction. “She’s letting the cat out and it’s running amok from what I hear though I haven’t seen it myself.”
“That cat’s after my quilt box!” Jones from the general store across the street from your apartment says and gets a few giggles from the ladies of the quilting club. One of them about his age tries to console the old man with a touch but he pulls away. Harriett watches for a moment and smiles, “She’s a nice girl, keeps to herself, and drives a small black car. “ Harriett scans the crowd under her brow nervously, trying to appear to be gazing down at her clipboard.
“I’ve seen a black car racing around last night before the sirens went off!” comes from somewhere in the crowd.
“Really? That’s interesting.” Harriett says, jotting it down. “If there’s anything else you discover, please let me know.”
You have a sinking feeling and look at Joe who’s staring at the group grimly.


You put the trail mix in your hand back into the bowl and slip out unnoticed with Joe, leaving the meeting still in session.
“What the heck, I’m going to be public enemy number one after all this!”
“Don’t worry about it, just a bunch of old hysterical hens. This will blow over. C’mon, I’ll buy you a coffee.”
“Joe, you own the coffee shop.”
”Ok, so I’ll write it off as a business expense.” And sticks his tongue out at you.
You walk off with Joe to get some coffee, you want to shake the feeling of being lynched and this is much better than walking home alone. You give him a slight shoulder bump as you walk.


Go to 28.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap28">
	<p> Meanwhile, in a dark stone room with few spotlights pointing at the long dark meeting table, figures in robes gather. Their faces covered in shadows.
“Anything to report?” a figure at the end of the head of the table asks.
Another speaks up. “We’ve spoken to the locals nearby regarding their recent rash of violence. It seems some peculiar things have occurred and they’re highly suspicious of each other.”
“Who is the agent there, let him speak.”
“Me sir, Gary.” He coughs and continues, nervously. “I’ve investigated the crimes, they seem quite random and unconnected. Most notable to the police is a man breaking into his neighbor’s house from his second floor to the other in his pajamas. There’s also the library that caught fire.
“What is so notable about the burglary?” asks a shadow with a nasally voice..
“Analysis of the crime scene shows the window of the burglar’s house to be forced out violently, and the victim’s smashed in. The burglar’s bruises do not indicate he did this intentionally, nor tried to steal anything. Just simply to lie on the floor in pain.” Gary catches his breath and tries to relax before there’s another question.
He knows his job, but they always make him feel like an initiate all over again.
“Interesting.” An even toned shadow replies, “..and what of the fire?”
His mentor’s voice helps him relax and encouraged to explain, “Its unusual to say the least. Unlike the incident between the neighbors, there was a deliberate break-in. They can’t tell if it was more than just that. The arsonist was captured, but the authorities are keeping that from the public. The arsonist and the janitor working the night shift didn’t see each other. From their individual stories, they must have been walking around in circles, never intersecting each other until the fire broke out.
There were a few minor acts of vandalism otherwise, but more than that, the populace’s routines were in juxtaposition.”
“How so?” asks the head shadow.
“Well sir, people tend to establish patterns in their lifestyle. They go to the same stores, walk the same routes. I’ve noted on this occasion that most of the people I surveyed that were farthest out from the center of town, were drawn in one way or another towards it. All the finer details are in the submitted report if anyone needs them.
“They could have simply been drawn to the activity, that’s nothing.” Says the nasally skeptic.
“When questioned, they have all done this before they knew what has happened. They weren’t simply drawn away from their normal routine.” He knew that skeptical voice all too well. Even though the order was about fulfilling a destiny for the common goal, this other master had always had doubts about his value to reach it. He didn’t understand why.
“Specifically I reference a Harriett Wynne in my report, who seems to stick her nose into everyone’s business, and spends a lot of time walking around town daily. Her suspicion confirmed my own.”


The head shadowy figure outstretches his hands gracefully.
“Let’s put this to vote, should we enact a full scale lock down of this small town?”

Hands went up along the table, some remain down. A scribe with a journal appears next to the head shadow and bows slightly.
“Well, let it be recorded. What is the tally?”


The scribe looks down at her markings. Is that a 6 or a 9?


Ah that’s definitely a 6. Go to 30.


No that’s a 9. I remember because I had the book sitting on my lap and I was distracted and must have turned it before I took down the tally. Go to 31.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap30">
	<p> The head of the order, once covered in shadows leans into the light. His tan robe draped across his shoulders and rests his elbows on the table so that his chin can rest on his entwined fingers. He speaks gently, “Gary, the activity is suspicious, you might have found something. You’ve been the agent there since you’ve reached agent status. You know that area the best. Go back and keep us apprised of the situation. Should the situation get any worse, we’ll have to lock down Schwenksville. Hopefully, you’ll be able to find the source and contain it.”
“Yes sir.” Gary gives a nod and a look over to his mentor, and walks out.
The nasally shadowed figure positions his hands beyond the darkness into one of the spotlights aimed at the table, making a subtle motion. Another figure standing against the dark wall leaves the room.


Go to 32.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap31">
	<p> The head shadow stands up, “It’s agreed, the threat is too serious to allow the people there to suffer or for it to spread beyond our reach any longer. Borden, you’re going to initiate the lock down. Find the source and report back, do what’s necessary.”
“Yes sir!” Comes from a stocky suited man, his strong physique noticeable within. The nasally shadow leans partially into the light, his large beak of a nose becoming visible as well as his deep wrinkles and looks at Borden, who returns his gaze.
Borden and his mentor give each other a knowing nod. There’s work to be done.


Borden acquires a vehicle from the Order’s fleet, a brown sedan with tinted windows. He heads off out in silence until he reaches the highway.
“They had to send Gary to Schwenksville, pffft! I knew all along that place was the hot spot but no one listened. Now they’ll see what a real agent of the Order can do. I’m going to shut down this place hard!” thumping the steering wheel to the last word.


Go to 33</p>
</div>

<div id="chap32">
	<p> Harriett concludes her neighborhood watch meeting and lets everyone out of the clubhouse so she can lock up. Alone, she remembers the recent tragedies. She also couldn’t forget the meeting with the man who appeared for a random “tourism” survey.
“How long has it been since you came down this street?”
“What kind of people like fresh air?”
“Are you predisposed to the left or the right?”
“Dogs or cats?”
“Do you like fruit cut into fun shapes?”
It was all nonsense to her but he looked official, so she answered the survey. Then she thought about what it could really mean, and the fact that he showed up just when everyone from the outskirts started coming around. What was going on? She thought. Howard normally didn’t come by this way, and to run into Millie who stays in all the time? That doesn’t happen often at all.
The man in the suit’s was very plain and distant, that started to worry her. Something bigger was going on, and she wanted to know. She told him about Howard, Jonesy, her power walks and healthy diet. The new neighbor Jane, with Mr Qiaokeli’s cat scampering around.  Telling him that she hasn’t seen that happen in about 9 years, that seemed to spark his curiosity. She thought he had the demeanor of a government agent, not what she was told. When she pushed for details, he became quite firm, making her scared. He told her not to be so nosey. That it could get her into trouble.
She wasn’t about to be threatened, but she couldn’t take him or whatever group he might be working for by herself. That’s why she formed the watch, something wasn’t right and better that everyone knew about it. She also thought it was good way to investigate Jane without too much suspicion. She saw her in the back of the clubhouse, but pretended not to notice, hoping that her agenda might get her to come forward. When she didn’t and left quickly, she knew that girl was up to something.


It’s only a matter of time before she finds out now.


Yes, Yes it is…. Go to 90.


No, its not….Go to 33.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap33">
	<p> A knock at the door startles her and she remains quiet. Slowly she puts her clipboard into the club’s safe box and locks it, stows it inside the desk. Harriett listens for a little while and nothing happens. Believing the knocker has left, she turns out the lights and heads back across the room to get her things. Suddenly the door shatters open at the knob.
A man hurriedly walks in. She can tell from the outline that he’s wearing a suit.
”Look, I’ve already told you what I know. I’ve already called the police!”
”I doubt it.” Says the man and rushes towards her.
“I’m doing what I can to keep everyone safe from…” her throat is crushed before she can utter any more words in her defense.
”I’m the one keeping everyone safe, from lunatics like you.”
The man in the suit rips the safe box out of the desk and walks out the door.


He throws the box into his car and gets in. It’s quiet out there, no one must have noticed. He decides he has time and breaks open the box with the edge of a screwdriver from under the seat. Inside are a few receipts and some quilt patterns that must have been somehow important, a letter from a Stan to some woman named Agnes, another from a Pete to the same, and the clipboard Harriett put in her desk. She had a vested interest in it while he peered through the window. This is enough to get things rolling he thinks. The clipboard’s top page is a meeting of the new neighborhood watch. He chuckles. There are three key points that were addressed. The first was a burglary at the Lackey residence, address listed, where they said their next-door neighbor jumped through their upstairs window. “Hmmm, how odd. He scans the rest with the same interest. I’ll look into these..”


Go to 34.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap34">
	<p> Pulling up to the Lackeys house, he could tell the neighbor to their left was the one. New windows are installed for both houses on the top floor. He decides to visit the neighbor. Its dark, there’s no one out on this rural street. Most houses in the neighborhood have a decent amount of space between them. These aren’t very far apart. He could have jumped from one rooftop to another, but it would have been next to impossible to even make it from one window to the other, breaking both along the way. “That has to be the Nexus’ doing.”
The Lackey’s seem to be up, the lights upstairs are on. However, the shades are drawn. The neighbor’s house is completely dark and he slips in unnoticed.
Stealthily reaching the second floor bedroom, he finds the neighbor already in bed tossing, just awake enough to grab onto the knee that’s now pressing on his chest.
“What’s your relation with your next door neighbor?”
“I..I..nothing! What are you doing here? Get off!”
“I don’t think so. Come on. Tell me. What’s the interest in the Lackeys, it sounds personal.” He lets the last word trail off. Even in the dark, the eyes of the assailant now crushing him are visible, wide and intense.
“I…we…are having an affair. She’s going to leave him...” He sighs, and then winces in pain. “But she won’t do it, she’s scared and I think he knows about it. Every day there’s something going on in that house. If he sees me, he tries to drag me into the middle of their fights, so I avoid them. Then SHE sends me a note or winks at me when he’s not looking, luring me back. I feel played, yet I still want her.” The forcefulness of his words strengthens his grip, slightly offsetting the pressure. “I get to spend every night here alone while she’s in his bed, toying with my emotions. It isn’t fair. I don’t want it to be this way!”
“Well you don’t have to worry about that any more.” A sudden slamming pressure is upon him and he gasps, accompanied by a sickening crack.


“Stupid people.” He wraps the neighbor up into a tight package with the bed sheet, making sure he has a good grip. “Now let’s see if I can pull this off…”. He takes the panes out of the window. Now, he could actually leap out from the window frame and probably get to the other, but he thinks he’ll let his new friend try.


The Lackeys can be heard arguing about some nonsense. The husband must be the one by the window so the neighbor can hear. To let him know who’s in charge he thinks.
In the Lackeys bedroom the husband berates his wife about some outfit she bought, the price and her reasons for getting it. Before he could finish, his new window and a heavy bundle in a bed sheet hit him in the back. A man in a suit swings into the room from the opening, stepping on the back of his neck as he surveys the room.
“Nice room. Oh, and you were right about your wife cheating on you.”
Maintaining his pressure on the husband’s neck. “Now,” he says, reaching into his coat, “I’m going to ask you a few questions.”
“No, I’m calling the police!!” She screams and turns towards the door.
”No.” His pistol already drawn, and fires off a silenced round. She falls against the door and slides down.

He takes his foot off the husband and sits on the bed holding the pistol at him. “Ok, here’s the question. Have you seen anything strange lately?”


In the middle of the night you are stirred awake. Max is asleep but fidgeting. He’s having a nightmare. His feet kick and sometimes his side flexes like hairs have been yanked out. You rest your hand on him and stroke his soft black fur that shines slightly in the light of the starry sky. When he kicks while your hand is upon him, you think you saw a face in the mirror of the dresser. You do a double take thinking it could have been yours but it wasn’t. A ghostly young man with a sickly face, holding his chest looking at you painfully, then vanishes. Your gaze darts around rapidly, trying to make out anything unusual in the room. Before you can relax again, there’s another flash by the door of a woman in a nightgown, followed by another man in his boxers. He’s facing you, only his head isn’t. It’s forced in the opposite direction. You let out little panicked scream and try to get up. The apparitions vanish. You stay up for hours, trying to figure out what it was. There’s nothing outside, the town is quite. Even with all the commotion you made, Max is still asleep. You decide that maybe you were just letting the last book you read get to you at the worst possible time.

<div id="chap36">
	<p> In the morning you feel a little better, however the ghosts are fresh in your mind.
“I’ll just toast away my nightmares, how about you Max?” Max is wandering around a little less perky than he normally is, his night wasn’t that good either you assume. Doctor Toast prescribes you two pieces of toast, with butter and strawberry jelly, which you smear on in hungry anticipation. “This is about as legible as most prescriptions, but far more delicious to eat.” You say just before crunching down on the toasted script. Not that you’ve been known to eat paper, lately.


Off in the distance you hear sirens. Upon instinct you look back at the toaster to make sure its not setting your apartment on fire, and then resume munching curiously.  Eventually the sirens fade out, you hope everything is ok wherever they’re going. You don’t bother to read, you just want to savor your breakfast and look out the window. After breakfast you jump into the shower.
While there, the images come back and you try to block them out by thinking about the last couple of days. Books, the cat, the stores, and the need for coffee. All of that was pretty good aside from poor Mister Qiaokeli, you hope he’s ok. You didn’t see his ghost last night thankfully. You hope that is a sign he’s not in any kind of trouble.


You get out and see that a parade is going right down your street. Confused at first but “Oh THIS must be the anniversary day.” Dismissing the sirens before as anything serious, just part of the parade you think. You head out and go along with the precession and reach the festivities on stage. A local band is playing and there is several booths set up for sausages, burgers, and the barely frequented vegan hut. You decide to take one for the veggies and try your luck. Turns out the Tofu Gyro is really REALLY good! You had forgotten to get a drink, and upon realizing this, the gyro thought it was its queue to get lodged in your throat.
As you struggle with the napkins and your meal getting out of control, a man steps up quickly and hands you his cup. “Café latte expresso-cino-bingo?” You don’t argue the name and drink it quickly while avoiding the ice chunks within. Relieved you hand it back to the guy who refuses. “I’m sure your backwash is pretty tasty but that one’s yours.” His brown silk shirt has a simple round sticker with a cup drawn on it with steam lines, and the word Joe.
“Thanks Cuppa Joe, you saved my life!”
“Now if I can only get you to say that in a commercial, I’d be rich!” You both laugh at that.
“So this is going well” You point to the band, “until my gyro tried to kill me.”
“I’m sure it didn’t mean any harm, most vegetables aren’t so hostile, how was it otherwise?”
“Really good!” you say then gulp and swash the drink around with your remaining snack with a satisfying “Ahhhh! So what’s this something –bingo?”
“I dunno, just threw a bunch of scraps together from the bean bags. So if you happen to like the combination, you win!”
“Win what?”
“A drink that doesn’t suck?”


“Good point.”
You watch the band for a bit, and then Joe offers to be your official festivity guide and Heimlich maneuver specialist on standby for the day. You and Joe check out all the booths, you’re personally introduced to each of the owners of the stores they represent. There’s even a booth for the local elementary school and library. The Librarian welcomes you and you sign up for a free library card while you’re chatting. She says she’s the only one at the table today because she can’t reach the janitor, called several times. Probably out with that reckless goon he hangs out with, getting drunk. Probably out barbequing behind the library again.


The day goes on, becoming late afternoon. You say goodbye to Joe and thank him for his company during the parade, touring the booths and the coffee shop he owns. You hope to see him again and call it a day. You decide to get some light reading in while you go over the jobs pending by half listening to the archived voicemail that’s forwarded to your email. Thankfully a few well-written emails with some preliminary data soothe the clients. You stretch and unfortunately remind yourself that you haven’t thought about those ghosts all day.


That night you sit up in bed, trying to stay awake to see if you can keep the ghost visions away. Max is out like a light moments after curling up in bed. “Nap attack!” You say quietly to him and stroke his fur. Your eyelids get heavy and you find yourself nodding off, sometimes imagining you’re falling and catch yourself.
At the foot of the bed is a man in dirty coveralls, like a janitor, pale and translucent. You are fixed to his stare. He’s accompanied by a man standing in the corner of the room with his back turned toward you. His head is down, and smoke is rising from his dark withered torso. You can almost smell burning wood.
“I’m Peter Jones’ brother, tell him to watch out! Take care of Agnes for me!”
The smoldering man says nothing. You can only hear him cry.
You burst from under the covers, startling Max who runs for to the closed door hitting it with a thud. Sitting still for a moment, tears well up and there’s nothing left to think, it’s so real to you and it’s driving you mad.
Crazy or not, you’re going to Jones’ General in the morning.


NEXT</p>
</div>

<div id="chap38">
	<p> Jonesy watches the customer closely, and the customer is watching him from the back aisle, his dark suit and shades making Mister Jones uneasy.  He watches him pick up something without even looking and head to the counter.
“How much is this?” The man asks.
”Well if you bothered to look at it, you would see its $1.40.”
“Maybe you can tell me where the cat food is?”
Mister Jones sighs and looks dead at him. “I don’t have time for this. If you want the cat food its in the corner over there. If you’re looking for a certain person and their cat, you’re wasting your time. If you continue to waste MY time, I’m going to call the police, understand?”
“You think I’m afraid of the police?! I OWN this town now.”
“I hate stupid customers.”
”YOU’RE THE ONE WHO”S STUPID!!!” The man pulls out a gun and fires off a few silenced rounds before Mister Jones can react, and falls upon the counter, fading fast.
In his last moments, he wished he had done more. At least Jane came to him this morning and told him, he decided to keep her safe by not giving this man the satisfaction of telling him what he knows. He watches the man look around, and kicks over his wicker chest and grabs the quilt from within. His last vision is of the man covering him with the quilt he was saving. The one with the panel “My darling Agnes” sewn on it.
“Aw geez.” fades from within the darkness consuming his consciousness.


NEXT</p>
</div>

<div id="39">
	<p> From your vantage point, you see how it goes down over at Jones’ General. “Jonesy!” you gasp. Your dream seems to have come true now, and if he’s come for Mister Jones then he must be coming for you next. You had told him about your dream in detail and he took it to heart, sighting the details of his brother you only thought you imagined. He told you that he’d be fine, but that you are probably in even more danger. Concerned you left, but kept an eye on him for a little while. Now you know.
Crouching down you try not to be seen when the man exits but your hiding spot is not that good, and too close to your apartment. You’d be seen for sure if you stay in one place.


You can’t go home, so you make a break for the back roads. Max follows you and you dodge as much traffic as you can by moving through alleys. You wish you had a jogging suit. Maybe he would think you were Harriett, maybe Harriett would get caught. That was a terrible thing to think, you correct yourself, no matter how much she reminds you now of your Aunt Stace and her pretentious attitude.
There’s a warehouse district up ahead. Seems like a good hiding spot for you. You carefully walk around the empty areas, looking for a spot to hold up and hide for a while with an office or exit within running distance from wherever you wind up.


You find an empty makeshift office in and old shipping container. It was either going to be an office or going to be demolished. The steel around the edges is coming apart at the seams or gone. Loose fitting panels are propped up over larger holes. You look through the desk for a weapon, a hat, or a cream filled snack. Max jumps up on the file cabinet next to the desk and tries to help look by overseeing you. Then Max hisses at something behind you and you grab whatever is in the drawer and point it at the man. “What do you want, who are you!”


He laughs. “I am Borden. I am an agent of the Order. You are my target. That’s all you need to know.”
“Just back off, I’ve done nothing to deserve this.”
“So you’re going to hold me off with and old insole?”
There’s a joke in there somewhere but you’re too tense to attempt it.
You are knocked to the ground. Just as he gets in closer, the agent is knocked aside by a 5-gallon drum. The agent recovers and tosses aside his broken shades. “And who the heck are you?”
“I’m Joe Cuppa, and I’ll be kicking your ass today.” Joe presses forward, putting himself between you and the agent.
“Don’t get in my way Cuppa!”


Joe makes a daring move, sweeping the agent’s feet out from under him. He then lunges on top and wrestles him into a choke hold. The agent is much stronger than Joe expected and pulls out of his grip steadily pulling Joe’s arms wide. He turns and pushes Joe, who slams into the side of the container making the panels shake.
He then pulls a gun out from behind his coat. What can you do?

You throw the insole at him! Go to 41.


You grab Max and throw him at Borden. Go to 72.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap41">
	<p> You toss the insole towards Borden but it’s not exactly made for being thrown and kind of misses, kind of never really gets more than a few feet away.
Max starts to scurry around rapidly and at the same time, you see Joe’s movements do the same. Joe dodges Borden’s gun and lands an uppercut and then a jab to the stomach. He turns the agent around and drives him into the file cabinet. Borden collapses to the ground.


Joe comes over to you, kneeling down. “Are you ok? We should really get out of here.”
“I’m not sure I can get up.” You struggle but you seem to manage. “You know, I thought this was all a dream I was having, so weird.”
”Oh no, this is real and its all your fault.” Borden says. The agent recovered without them knowing and still has his gun, pointed directly at you.


Max leaps for the agent but he grabs him in mid air. “Thanks for the cat, but no thanks!” and punts Max out the opening. “You show up in town and everything changes suddenly. My order has been tracking you for a very long time and I’m the one who’s going to put an end to it all. We’re going to wipe this town off the map. No one will ever know.
Once my mentor comes to power, nothing will stop us”
Borden raises his gun and with a smile says, “So Nexus, have any last words?”


“You’re pretty stupid you know that Borden?” Go to 71.


“Drop it Borden!” Go to 42.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap42">
	<p> “I said drop it Borden!” repeats the voice from behind him. Another agent is standing there with his gun pointing right at him.”
“Well Gary, the old ‘soft touch’, you really know how to handle that thing or should I help you? Look I found the Nexus, we can shut down this whole place now.”
”I don’t think so. This town doesn’t deserve to be destroyed; you’re a fool to think that. Just like your mentor, greedy and insane.”
“You’re not going to stop me!”
Borden and Gary become very still. Within the minds of the agents, they are locked into a mental showdown. It was a common exercise for the initiates to force their will upon another. The stronger were able to do it without any physical contact to increase their chance of success. The fatigue is getting to Gary, but he breaks the connection in time to see that Borden was merely using that as a distraction to shoot.
Gunshots go off simultaneously. You and Joe drop down as low as you can.
When the ringing in your ears subsides, you look up over the desk that was between you and the agents and see they have both fallen back. Borden does not move. Several shots are in a small grouping around his chest.


Go to 52.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap43">
	<p> On your way home you pick up some more goodies to pass the time, and a cat toy for your new chummy fuzzy guy and get home with a brisk walk that almost reminds you of Harriett. You wonder if she’d like the competition.
You get inside the house and sit with your cat and some tea. You read while playing with the cat toy on a stick for Max with one hand. On his back, he frantically tries to paw at it, his mouth and eyes are wide open. The expression of “OH MY GOD I HAVE TO CATCH THAT THING!!” clearly visible on his puffy face makes you laugh.


You get through your tea and book and stretch out on the couch for a nap. Max creeps up beside you for a nap as well. When you wake up, he’s found a better spot on top of your chest, his eyes shut and sleeping. Lifting your head puts you nose to nose with him and he peeks at you through the tiniest of slits. You stretch but he only adjusts slightly to stay comfortable during. Do you really want to wake him up?


Yes, you think its time to get up. Go to 65.


Well, who am I to disturb his slumber? You rest some more, sleep over to 44.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap44">
	<p> You nap and nap some more; it’s very comfortable just to stay here on the couch.
You wake to the early morning light and stretch out. You remember you need to start getting your assignments done and hurry through breakfast. Even with rushing through the settings, your toaster still pulls it off successfully. He’s a genius, and you’d pat him on the top if it weren’t for the possibility of getting seriously burned.


You manage to be alert enough to proof all the documents the client has forwarded you to your laptop that are due asap and send them back in a few hours. You still have till the end of the week to finish the rest. You close the connection and clear up the clutter on your system so you can start fresh again later. For some reason, even with working on a computer, you still wind up with a disorderly mess of files on the desktop that only make sense while you’re deep into the job. Afterwards, it’s anyone’s guess. You shut off the laptop and push it away. Done.


The cat meows at you from the kitchen and you give him some food and what’s left of the cereal you had with your toast. You go and take a break outside on the deck to read, the cat pops up in the window to watch.


After a nice bit of reading you feel like you want to get up and go out. Where too?


You get in the car and drive. Drive on over to 18.


You take a walk, but wait, go to 45.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap45">
	<p> You put the book down. You were done reading it anyway, and go for a walk.
You spot Max in the window, just sitting there, politely staring at you. That’s when you…


   …go to let him out, and he runs to 79 –go NOW!


   OR…tell him you’ll see him later and walk down the decks to the sidewalk.


The sidewalk is a bustle of activity and you walk around the town square to see what’s going on. There’s balloons and local music, everyone is checking out the band and waiting in line at the half dozen or so food stands set up to either side in front of town hall in a week long celebration. There’s a local coffee shop with a “Happy Birthday Schmedleyville!” banner across the entire shop window. That can’t be the name, some kind of in-joke you suspect. You can’t really see what’s inside. You head over to watch the band play.


It’s a little country, and rock n’ roll. Not bad, the food’s pretty good too. You see Harriett going on about something and eating a salad, probably her being fit and such. You bet the salad came from her house.


You strike up a few conversations with people beside you who like the band or simply proud of living here. You hope that one day you can say the same thing. Where you can say you’ve been here for “forty some odd years and love it.” Even the older women say, “They’ll never let the true spirit of the town die.” You think that’s great, even though you still have some interest in traveling. It would be nice to have a home base to come back to.


It gets later in the day and you make it back to the apartment. You get to your apartment and there’s Max in the window. You wonder if Max has really sat there the whole time just staring out the window. “Kinda weird.” You say at him through the window and open the door. He jumps down and you pick him up above your head. “Hey Max, what’s shakin’?” and you shake him a little, and then hold him while wandering around the house.
It gets late and you make a small snack of chips and dip and go to bed, leaving the dip out for your furry friend.
As you pull the covers up, you hope the zombies from the last dream don’t find you tonight. Last time they nearly ran off with your leg. If they go after the one with the cupcake tattoo on it, they’re toast! “Mmm, toast.”


NEXT</p>
</div>

<div id="chap46">
	<p> You wake up today fairly well and with all your limbs intact. You make the most of them by getting them to walk out into the kitchen. You sit down with your assorted breakfast gear and give Herr Toast his orders. That’s at least his name today, there’s nothing official. He returns a toast with his usual flare and you thank him kindly.
You zip through the pages of the current novel and nearly choke down the toast forgetting how to chew and swallow correctly with being so engrossed in the pages of zombie-slaying horror. Some juice to the rescue!
You put the book down and focus on everything outside. It’s a pleasant day. Off in the distance, a white clad walker strides quickly past the intersection up ahead. You can assume who that is. There isn’t much activity otherwise.
You’re compelled to get out too. After breakfast, you slide everything into the sink and head for the shower.
You consider your form in the mirror while the shower’s water heats up, decide you’re fine, not what Aunt Stace would have you believe, and get in.
The water is nice and while soaping up you sing, “Don’t want to be thin…” even though you can’t say you’re fat, just not one of those aerobics teachers either. “F’n Stace!”
For a little while you stand there caught up in “her views” and the hectic life you had juggling life in the city. This is so much simpler now. You think everyone should do it.
The showers are normally good, but now you’re stressed. You dry and throw your brown-red-whatever color you tried recently hair around till it falls in the right places and get dressed.


You tune in the radio Mister Qiaokeli left and the local news comes on. Nothing eventful than what you already knew about. Must be rather dull for newscasters around here.
You switch stations and hit on something soothing. Not your normal cup of tea but leaving it on relaxes you. You did want to go out, but the sofa’s looking mighty nice.


Try out the couch for a bit, just a bit…to 54.


Go out and explore the woods, 47.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap47">
	<p> You resist the alluring comforts of the sofa, “Must…resist…” and pull yourself out the door.
You decide to start your day with a little hike. Unsure where Max is, he’s not anywhere to be seen, but you’re quite sure he’s safe and head out. With a water bottle you take one of the neighborhood streets and walk towards the woods. Most of the houses are separated by a good deal of space, could have been small farms, but two are right next to each other.
A man is outside, pruning the bushes quietly while his neighbors argue with each other. The husband tends to yell at his wife about something, occasionally looking at the pruning neighbor for a reaction. He continues to prune, obviously bothered.


You venture ahead to the expansive woods taking up your field of view. You think there’s probably dozens of trails all along the town by the surrounding wood. You imagine one leads to an underground sanctum. It’s arcane secrets hidden away for ages, all eldritch or gibbony. The latter could go either way, you like monkeys.


You shake off the peculiar thoughts and march into the brush away from any potential eyes of the neighborhood you just passed.


Deeper in the woods the canopy is quite dense, almost dark enough to be night in some areas. You wish you brought a machete or a flashlight. You try to stay in the light and avoid the thicker brush, looking for signs of paths made by other people, or even deer. As always you come across a soda can or a tire that has made it deep into the woods. After a while hiking, the brush is not as thick here. You can hear water running farther out and a small footpath.


Do you follow the path? Go to 48.


“NO! I make my own way now!” You forge ahead crushing everything in your path, including, “Ow! This thing stuck to my foot….” Go to 112.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap48">
	<p> The path winds among huge fallen trees, the sound of water still up ahead. At one turn you cannot get by easily, it’s blocked and the footing crosses some high roots. Grabbing on to the branch ahead, you force it away only to make another hit you in the face, obscuring your vision. You make another step forward, letting go of the tree to clear the branches when your foot becomes caught, sending you forward. With the branches pulled away you can see you’re falling off the edge down a hillside. Rolling across the steep embankment head first to finally slam to the ground at the bottom.
You figure this is a good spot to take a nap, just a little one…no…need to….get up.
…
…
…
NEXT!</p>
</div>

<div id="chap49">
	<p> As you awake, the blur becoming trees of a dimly lit forest, you realize it’s been a long time lying in the muddy earth. You get up and check yourself for all the usual critters that could have made your body its home while you were out, and also find that your bruises aren’t too bad considering the fall.
A flickering light up ahead catches your attention. Men’s voices can be heard. You creep forward as silent as possible. A group of men in dark robes sit cross-legged on the ground in a circle around the embers of a fire. Torches placed behind each man form the outer circle. Each member has his hands outstretched to the embers while performing a low guttural chant. Wisps of smoke from the burning embers thicken and combine, taking a variety of shapes you haven’t seen smoke do before.  The shapes are more organic and becoming even more defined, assembling into a larger mass. The mass rotates in the air above the glowing embers, which change from its fiery orange to blue. The mass takes on the color in a texture of veins rolling around it until it stops rotating. In front of the men is a huge bust of a man, translucent and blue, wispy lines outlining the figure. 
The apparition appears to be at peace, and yet a little concerned if not sad for being summoned.
They speak to the shape but you cannot hear and creep closer.
“Maybe now you can tell us where the Nexus is?”
“All that you need, you see, it as simple as that. Do not try to upset the balance in your favor.” The form speaks these words, the pitch varied and faint, lacking substance.
“It’s for the ‘favor’ of all mankind that we do this.” One answers in a nasally tone.
“Not all, not you.” The spirit says, “Balance for all kind, all kinds of life. Even no life.”
“I see you can say that from your new perspective.” The nasal one says slyly.
“Enough. We are not here to harass the dead despite your OWN agenda!” the voice of another commands, keeping his voice low.
The ghostly figure turns his head, directly looking at you. You recognize the face immediately.
”Mister Qiaokeli!” you gasp and grab your mouth quick. You don’t see a reaction from the group yet you feel an acknowledgement from his spirit.
You back up slowly, careful about the twigs beneath your feet when you are grabbed and gagged from behind by a pair of hands. You feel the sharp edge of something up against your arm from where he’s holding.


“Shhhh! Be quiet!” the man says softly. “They don’t know you’re here, better if they don’t because then I’ll have no choice. If you don’t struggle, I can let you go. Then I’ll explain everything if you’ll just…”


Do you struggle?
“Damn right!” Go to 75!


“Ok, you win…” Go to 50.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap50">
	<p> “That’s better.” He says and let’s you go. “You wouldn’t have liked the alternative. I’m Gary, and OOF! –“ He’s knocked back and falls, not expecting you to connect with a right hook. Neither did you but you’re not taking any chances. You run as fast as you can away back the way you came. Disoriented and blind, running in the dark forest you hope to find a way out. You feel out the least dense brush ahead of you to move as quick and quiet as you can. After about an hour you find yourself in the back lot of a row of stores, tripping and falling into the garbage bags.


 Joe is a bit unsure about the shabby, smelly, patron that’s covered in mud walking into his store but thinks “Hey, if it buys some coffee, then its ok.” Joe passes a glance to his clerk who merely shrugs, giving him a warm but confused smile.
The strange character comes up directly to Joe instead of the counter.
”Joe, there’s a guy after me. He’s part of some cult. I’ve seen a ghost! Mister Qiaokeli is dead!”
“Holy cow! Wait…Jane? You’ve got to get that junk off. You’re safe here, go into the back and clean up. Go on!”
When you get into the bathroom you are face to face with some kind of she-sasquatch. The leaves, twigs and assorted trash tangled into your hair create a mask of grime and confusion. You’re completely covered in mud and anything that stuck to you along the way. You decide that Joe is going to have a pretty hefty water bill.
After an hour with the automatic hand dryer, after cleaning yourself and the floor, you emerge from the bathroom a bit more recognizable. Fortunately he had enough soap too, cause its all gone now. Your clothes are nearly clean yet damp and your hair pulled back into a ponytail. You sit down at the table Joe is at and he slides you a big cup of his latest brew and you tell him the whole story.


“That’s incredible. So what does the guy who grabbed you look like? Joe says after taking a sip and slouching back in his high backed chair, grasping the top firmly.
“A suit I think, I didn’t take an inventory after I clocked him.” You take a sip and add, “Well I’m sure he looks like crap by now if he was chasing me.”
“Oh so like that guy?” and Joe nods over to the door now opening. A man in a dirty ripped suit staggers in, his hand pressed against his side under his coat.
“All right, wait a second.” Gary says coming into the doorway.


You jump to the side against the wall while Joe launches in some kind of coffee shop owner ninja move that flings his chair at Gary.


Gary falls back against the door, the chair shattering on impact. He makes no attempt to get up, only giving you a painful helpless look under the pile of splintered chair. “I really wanted to help, please, stop.”
Both of you come over and look at each other, then him, then start removing debris, making sure to keep his hands in view. You both pull at the one under his coat, thinking there’s a gun. Gary finally gives up and you see he’s been holding his hand over a bullet hole.
“What the heck?” You say to him.


Go to 52.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap52">
	<p> Gary slumps down on his side, you both come over and sit next to him.
“I found out through my investigations that your cat was the Nexus.”
”The What-us?” Joe says.
“That’s what my order called it when they created it.” You both look at him oddly but allow him to continue. “My order had been using deep mediation techniques and their other abilities to influence the fate of others, the higher goal was for the benefit of mankind. He pauses to catch his breath. “They took it to a new level and wanted to tap into Fate itself, our lifelines, how we make choices, like the threads of the Tapestry of Life if you believe in such a thing.
“Like a cat playing with string.” You say, putting it together.
“Yes. But the process became tainted by greed within the order. Plus I don’t think we’re really supposed to have that kind of power. They managed to pull just a piece of it out of …I don’t know where, the consciousness of the universe? Something within the ethereal plane? I have learned enough to perceive the Nexus under the right conditions but I don’t know how they managed it. In any event it got away from them. We had no idea what it looked like but believed it would take on physical form and its area of affect would be small. We were sent out to search the world if need be, I was assigned here.” Gary breathes hard and Joe tries to make him a little more comfortable. Gary doesn’t want to be moved.
“Fortunately I got to you, the others in my order wouldn’t have made this end pleasant.”
He pauses and checks the wound near his gut.
“Borden, the other agent, he’s been approaching my leads, did horrible things. He could have killed you if I didn’t intervene. When I shot him, he managed to get me too.”
“Mow?” You hear from behind. Max has a look like he wants to know what’s going on here. You and Max lock stares. Looking deep into his eyes, a strange connection is made like tiny threads have invaded your very soul. You’ve never been affected like this. You now feel tethered to a part of what Max, the Nexus, is.
You consider the lines that must run to everyone, how he pulled them when he was out running around, and the things that Mister Qiaokeli had told you. You might just believe what Gary’s telling you now.
“Here, you must get your cat to the part of the park by the lake, and say this.”
He hands you a card, then grabs his side in pain. “I’m going to be ok, but you should get going now, before anyone can stop you.”


NEXT</p>
</div>

<div id="chap53">
	<p> You grab Max, and Joe comes with you to where the park meets the lake. As you get closer to the lake, you stop and put a hand up to Joe.
“I need to do this alone.” You smile, holding back the urge to cry, and give him a kiss. He understands and waits as you head for the lake.
You hold Max up to look him in the face and smile through the tears. You hug him and he nuzzles up against you. He understands this is his time to go. The clear night sky gives you plenty of light and a nice view of the lake reflecting the sky above, putting you in the middle of the universe. You hold Max to you, watching the water in silence for a while. You tell him, “If this crazy thing doesn’t work, you’re still my cat. You’re staying with me. Got it?” and give him a satisfying rub.
You look down at the card in your hand and memorize the pattern of words, which are more like sounds that you need to make. You let go of the card and take a deep breath, pet Max one last time and hold him up to the sky.


As you begin making the sounds, Max becomes still, slowly his silken black fur turns pale, and his body slumps down in your hands. Then a wind kicks up, followed by Max expanding slightly and vibrating wildly. You continue, and his form becomes abstract, yet still cat shaped. As a cat made of pure energy now, you utter the final phrase.


There is a flash of bright light that accompanies it when spoken.


“Boomshanko!” and poof you're sent to 78.


“Odinkidoo!” Go to 77.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap54">
	<p> You stretch out on the couch, it’s so comfy you’re having trouble staying awake. You think that’s odd since you just got up not too long ago. You wonder about the power a couch can have over people, how it creeps up on you and strikes without warning, then you fall asleep.


Outside, a dark brown long sedan passes along the road slowly. The interior is not visible. It doesn’t stop or slow down, the owner of Jones’ General notes that it looks just out of place around here, giving the car a scowl.


Joe runs the coffee shop near the town hall. He stops and thinks about flavor. He smirks that he knows HE has flavor but what about his coffees? He thinks Almond Fudge Ripple and jots it down on the chalkboard quickly, grabs his coat and heads out to the grocery store to find the extracts before someone orders it. As always, leaving the girl at the counter to fend for herself with a parting wink. If she could, she’d show him a thing or two about flavor. Maybe Knuckle Sandwich if he keeps this up, she smiles and waves goodbye.


Harriett completes another successful lap on her grand power walking circuit and retires for the day. She pats her husband on the bald spot of his head as she walks in and proceeds to put her walking suit into the washer with all the brightening detergent she’ll need. He continues to read the paper as she rummages for a bottle of spring water and stands in the doorway to the kitchen in her shorts and sports bra. They glance at each other with a smile before she turns to make salads for both of them. He remarks to himself, “She’s fit all right, but man does she have to be a damn prima donna about it?”


Hours later, you wake from your nap attack a little groggy. Max has helped the couch by weighing you down. You give him a rub and turn to give him the chance to jump off slowly on his own before he’s pushed off. You’re too sleepy to go out and just lounge about the apartment instead, occasionally looking at work and keeping up on a few comments by friends online. They wonder what you’re up too and you reply it’s hard to say with all the napping. You get a few completed jobs out to your clients when you’re more awake. Then spend time with the cat and eating a little. You note Max still has no desire for toast. He doesn’t like peach jelly either.


Its not too late yet, at the very least a few hours left till sunset. You leave Max behind to play with his toys and head out up the street away from town. You go past a few blocks of neighborhood to the right with an overgrown meadow and a farm off on the left. At the end of the sidewalk there’s a statue of what you assume would be the founder of this town. It’s a bald man wearing glasses, in a suit, holding a book. You think it’s a law book but hope it’s really a horror novel. Just across the street is a wooded park and you think it’s about a quarter of a mile through it to the lake.


You investigate the park. Go to 22.


OR….Next </p>
</div>

<div id="chap55">
	<p> You walk through the park, heading for the lake. Go to 70.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap56">
	<p> The trip has convinced you that it’s better to stay home, at least in the general area. It might be better altogether if you keep your conversations to a minimum.
You see Max, he gives you a curious tilt-head look from the windowsill and you go over to pick him up. You give him a hug and he purrs, that’s all you need and start to cry. He’s happy to stay like that for as long as you want. That is until he’s hungry.


Sitting down on the couch with Max, you start to think about all that has happened, its unbelievable! How can this little cat cause so much trouble?


Suddenly, there’s a knock at the door.


If you open it, go to 62.


If you wait for a minute and see what happens, next.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap57">
	<p> The figure at the door is obscured by the haze and swirly texture of the glass, but it appears to be a tall build that you assume to be a man. Standing there for a few minutes, it doesn’t seem like he sees you and makes no attempts to try the doorknob. You make no movements or sound, keeping Max still in your arms. He knocks again and waits for what seems like an eternity before moving away quietly. Creepy.


NEXT.</p>
</div>


<div id="chap58">
	<p> You go to the door and quickly open it. Max darts out to check as well. Looking around there is no one.


Later, in a dark walled conference room of stone, its members sit in the shadows just outside the small spotlights that illuminate the dark oval glass table. At the head of the table is a man in a suit and cloak with its hood over his head. With elbows on the table and fingers crossed, he ponders the details of the reports they recently discussed. Additional people arrive and take seats along the lengthy table.


“Devoted colleagues, for those of you who have just joined us we have decided on a course of action based on the information we have been gathering. Our occasional surveys of the nearby towns have indicated there is nothing pointing to the Nexus.
However Schwenksville had one of it oldest residents out by the lake, near death and in a peculiar state. This coincided with a few crimes in town, nothing major.”


“And what of the old man” Asks one of the cloaked figures.
“ He wouldn’t speak, and our interrogation pushed him beyond his limit.”


Another figure from the shadows speaks up, his voice cool and steady, “We had his house checked out, zero indications.”


The head speaker continues, “Which is why we are going to retract once again from investigating the local area and focus on our agents abroad. California and Washington usually have some bizarre and unexplained events happening, we are going to focus on that.” He looks around at the table considering everyone’s reaction, there is none. “Dismissed.”


You go on with your life blissfully unaware of the horrible fate that could have befallen the little town you now call home. Hopefully you and Max can stay out of trouble.


The End.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap59">
	<p> Agent Gary takes his car back around the town, peering through the tinted windows at the passers by, taking mental notes on where they go and what they do. Normal, he’s studied these people for some time since being assigned to this area ever since the nexus got away. If only they knew what it looked like, all he heard as it could be described was like pure energy given life. It emerged from the very center of the circle the order had made to focus and meditate on. It bounded around the chamber until it escaped in a flash. Gary wasn’t even there. He was merely an initiate then. At the time he was being conditioned through meditation and mental exercises to enhance his awareness and perception. These would be needed for the mysteries the order would try to unravel.
What his order was doing was big stuff, only the mentors and higher could be present to participate. They would not disclose much information, only that it could change the course of events for the worse if it could not be contained or controlled. He worried about the latter. A group within the order had its own agenda, he was sure of it.
He was told to find clues of strange or subtle behavioral changes in the populace and see if those changes led to a single point. That point could be what they referred to as the Nexus and it could be anything. “Animal, vegetable, or mineral?”
He tested his theory that the trail of the Nexus would make it self evident if he surveyed the people every once in a while, asking questions which they often did gladly. They thought he worked for the town or a big corporation that was going to send them more business or tourism. They probably wouldn’t have guessed the origin was more akin to a monastery.
He found that seemingly random questions often lead to a more precise gauge of who a person was, and how set in their ways they were. To catch them off guard may show more about them than a straightforward questionnaire they might expect.
It also wasn’t so random. Catching whatever the Nexus is meant profiling the entire town. It takes all kinds of information for that.
Gary relaxes his posture and takes a deep breath. “Yes subtle and mysterious, that’s my game.” He says to his ego. “I show up like the MIB, tracking down the intangible, the elusive. No one really knows what’s going on. The entity called the Nexus, something that can’t easy be seen or detected. I….”
A black cat runs across the street towards a park. And while that normally wouldn’t get his attention, the fact that numerous people appear to be drawn out of their way in its general direction raised an eyebrow. The small concrete park in what this town would call the “business district” doesn’t usually bring as much attention as the one by the lake, he’s made note of this time and time again. It’s actually a little inconvenient and positioned away from most businesses. If it were in any other town, it’d be ruined and graffiti would be all over it because of that. They keep it nice, and even installed a water feature to commemorate a local achievement. Something along the lines of “Nothing ever happens here.” He muses. He can’t really remember. Sad but true, his research showed that very little goes on, and what does is static, near clockwork on a subconscious level. He thought that might actually be a clue. If the Nexus causes action, maybe it takes away action that would have happened too.
Gary pulls over and gets out of his car and watches for a little while. The cat races to a person on a park bench, she bends down to pet him but then the cat looks down the road and backs up a bit. A man about the same age as the woman from that direction comes up directly to her. He says he noticed something stuck to the back of her coat. They strike up a conversation. Gary scans over to the cat that is playing with some bugs on the pavement now. “Curious. But maybe that was just a coincidence?” Gary thinks, his arms crossed while leaning against the car. Then the cat looks right at him. Its almost as if they share a moment without time, nearly invisible lines branch out from all directions from its source, the pair of cat eyes that are staring into his own. His mind is slipping from focus when the cat breaks his stare and heads for a nearby fountain. His mind is now feeling completely blank. All he can think is, “what? I should go to the fountain?” He’s about to get up, when from right behind him a couple walking together say, “Hey, lets go check out the fountain!” He turns sharply to the couple, sliding his sunglasses back up with a finger. He snaps himself out of it and meets the gaze of the couple passing by him.
“Lovely day, have you ever noticed….” He pauses, unable to concentrate.
“We thought the same thing!” The woman of the couple says with a giggle. He watches them walk off together. He stays watching the area until near dusk and loses sight of the cat but he’s sure it will come by again. “That has got to be it!” He says out loud to himself enthusiastically.
“Hello?” Comes a friendly voice from a person briskly walking by. She’s a middle-aged woman in a bright jogging suit.
“Ma’am?” he says plainly, adjusting back into his stiffer agent persona.
“What has ‘got to be it’ young man?”
“I was putting together the findings of my survey. So how long has it been since you came down this street?”
“Oh every day. I was here this morning too. Just what I do to stay healthy and fit!”
“So you like the fresh air? I think every body does.”
“Oh yes! I think so. Don’t just stay in your house breathing in whatever comes through the cracks, you can get cancer that way!”
“Really, I never heard that one. So you normally walk on this side or on the left over there by the fountain?”
“Normally this side I guess, I never really took notice of the fountain. Then again, I don’t always come by this way.”
“That so? Any one else showing up when they normally don’t?”
”Just Howard. I haven’t seen him in a while, at least not out walking around. He usually keeps to his own corner of the neighborhood. Somewhat true about Jonesy too.”
“Jonesy?”
“Yes, from Jones’ General.”
“Yes, I’m familiar with him actually.”
“Well, he’s a bit of a crabby pants and only goes from his store to his house. But lately he’s seems a bit extra agitated, doesn’t like to share what’s on his mind as it is.  Now he’s just mean. Sad really, one of the ladies in my quilting club likes him too.”
”Really, lucky him. So what brings you down this way now?”
“Well I was talking to my husband earlier and we suddenly had a craving for one of those salads the grocer by here puts together, you know, the one with the fruit cut into fun shapes?”
“No I haven’t tried that, you like them?”
“Well I’m out here aren’t I?” and Harriett chuckles, “So what brings you out here?”
“I’m doing a survey for a travel company. The information I gather helps us direct tourism to the local areas, helps business you see.”
”My, that’s wonderful! You’re doing a great job!”
”Uh, thanks. So tell me, do you like dogs or cats?”
“Well I’ve always loved dogs! Cats? I’m not so sure. But our new neighbor Jane has a lovely black cat. He has a very healthy coat. A bit rambunctious though. I see him running all over town, he could get hurt that way. She should keep him in the apartment like Mister Qiaokeli did all these years.
“He used to never come outside has he? Are you sure this cat belongs to Jane now?”
“Yes she took over his apartment, I’ve only met her briefly but talked to the landlord. She has red hair, about 25-35 years of age. Owns a small black car. I think she came from the city from the way she dresses. She’s very fond of the cat and very much still like a tourist while trying to settle in. I hear she likes coffee too.”
“You know that’s an awful lot of information for someone you just happen to meet. I wouldn’t invest so much time in her business, it could get you in trouble.”
“Well I… must be off -yes! Have to burn these calories before I put more on, ta-ta!”
“Goodbye.” Gary watches her leave. This could be the same cat, has to be, he’ll have to go back to see this Jane person, without nosey neighbors. This could mean a full-scale lock down if he can’t contain it, which can be very bad for everyone here.


Go to 86.</p>

<div id="chap62">
	<p> You shoosh Max into the bedroom and go to the door. The man there is dressed in a dark suit and sunglasses. He keeps still and quiet, waiting for you. “Yes, uh, can I help you?”
“Ma’am, I’m in the area doing a survey. I was wondering if you could answer a few questions?”
“Well, ok. Sure.” thinking it will distract you from the day you’ve had so far.
“Ma’am, what do you find to be your favorite cheese?” says the man rather plainly without any kind of enthusiasm.
“Well, I suppose Munster? Or maybe just some good old American I guess.”
“Has anyone you come into contact lately changed your opinion of cheese?”
“No.”
“Have you been sleeping ok?”
“Yes, fine.”
“Have you woken up somewhere else in the house or elsewhere?”
“Elsewhere?”
“As in another house or part of town?”
“I don’t sleepwalk if that’s what you mean.”
“No, it isn’t. Have you seen any peculiar activity in the past month or so?”
“Not really, I’ve only moved here a few days ago.”
“And the man who lived here?”
“Oh um, of all things he’s in the park.”
“Well I regret to inform you that he passed on. We’re, I’m sorry.”
“What?!”
“Good day ma’am.” He says as he steps in, by which you flinch at. He grabs the door and closes it. Leaving you alone inside.


You are severely shaken by all this and what's... Next.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap63">
	<p> There’s no point of it now, you’re keeping to yourself from now on. You don’t want to answer the door anymore that’s for certain.


You can order what you want online if you really have to. The work is steady and you continue to get offers for more. So long as that continues you’re quite content and Max will be fine, and so will everyone else.


Your pal, Toaster-McGigments, will be there for you. The three of you will make a good team, and a safe life together. Even if Max still has no desire to eat toast, his interest in butter is another story.


NEXT.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap64">
	<p> Weeks go by. You keep the cat very close to you. Everyday you get up and pet the cat, hold him for a bit, do your work, have supplies delivered, pet cat, play with cat. You keep the windows and doors locked and visitors away. Sometimes you look outside and watch the world go by, satisfied that nothing will happen to them that shouldn’t. They’re safe so long as you stay in here.
You lie to your friends online that you’re staying offline most days, due to your suddenly poor connection speed and you’re simply enjoying the rural life far too much. This helps you stay focused on Max.
Max is plenty happy that you’re around so much and you honestly love him to pieces. Sometimes he jumps at the door, putting his whole body stretched out against the window with a thud. It worries you, chasing him back into the bedroom and shut the door those days.


You know what it would mean if he got out. You stay there for the rest of your life with Max.


The End.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap65">
	<p> You wake with a roll and Max leaps off of you, leaving a warm spot on your chest. Stretching helps take out some of the kinks and with a wide yawn you head over to the fridge. You spy some bread and look at the toaster, who looks confidently back at you with a singular bulb for an eye.
“Ok, maybe one slice. Then get down to business.” Somehow you’re “talked” into about four slices. Two of which you spread liverwurst on. Some may disagree with your methods, your choice of spreads, but who can deny the power of toast to make anything better. You wash it down with a local beverage, some kind of Lively Lizard Ale whose label looks better than the contents taste and slide your laptop over.


You spend several hours working. Companies send you their information, and under a contract of information privacy, you proofread and file reports on everything from diagnostic procedures, to the latest articles on hairstyles and upcoming literary works.
Then you send the contents back by the deadline and they forward the payment to your accounts. This day and age, you can work anywhere there’s coverage. You were concerned with signal strength in this area. The thought of dial-up nearly hurt your stomach, but since your aunt Stace was able to bug you almost all the way here on speaker phone, you then had no doubt.


Aunt Stace was only half the problem; thankfully you left no forwarding address. Even more thankful that you set your phone to filter out incoming calls directly to voicemail, and explicitly told her this was a “business line”. Like she cares. It helps, you check the messages and there are only the ones from clients to deal with, for now.


You go through the messages and take down the secure login information and what to do. Then you’re back to work and update the clients with a quick message on your status.


Finally you’re done and nearly too tired to stay up when you take a moment to check your email. You keep in touch with a small group of friends you’ve met from traveling all over the world. So you pop on to do the social networking thing and see what they’re doing or saying, and poke fun at them for it. You post to a few, “Got the place and a free cat, sweeet! Max says m’ow! Falling asleep now [thunk!] LOL, LMAO, ROFL, and ETC” for Eats Tasty Cake as well as other things, ending with a quick “bye!” then log off.


You notice that its way late now. So you wash up and fall dead into bed and bury yourself under the covers. You wonder if the undead ever get tired or maybe it feels just like this all the time. Sufficed to say, your dreams now have a theme to use.


The next morning is on 67.


However, there was a problem with that on 66.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap66">
	<p> It’s the middle of the night and you’re staring at patterns the moonlight makes in your bedroom. A feeling of dread comes over you; a building tension fills the air. A figure is standing in the doorway. You cannot make out his features. His head cocks to the side with a crack and his breathing is erratic, he staggers over quickly to you with a moan. Landing on top of you, you brace his fall and try to hold his pressing weight. The moonlight reveals his face, its horrible. His right eye is completely exposed, as there’s no skin around it down to his jaw. Its as if its been ripped or chewed away. With all your strength you push and knee him over the left side of the bed, hitting his head on the nightstand. The lamp falls on him, its glass shattering on this ghoul, this zombie!
You push yourself through the tangle of covers and out the other side of the bed, heading for the window. You can hear him scrambling to get up and his moans penetrate your very core, increasing your fear. You make it out the window just as you feel his hands on you, but you’re free.
Rolling off the roof to the incline below with a thud, you manage to push yourself up and view the cemetery ahead as your only escape. The moonlit night creates an eerie stillness, chilling your soul. You make it through the cemetery. From all angles they shamble towards you, some still crawling out from their graves, the embalming fluids come oozing out from gaping mouths and torn flesh.
A root catches your leg, then a hand up from the disturbed soil. Distracted, the closest ones grab you. Alone, with no one to hear your cries, you try to fight but they’re pulling you down upon a muddy grave.
They start biting one by one, sinking easily into your flesh that comes off in every bite. Your screams muffled by their sheer numbers writhing on top of you in this gory feast. They’re pulling at your arms and legs harder and harder. Feeling as if they might rip away…


BRRRRRRRRINNNNNNG!


Go to PAGE 67.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap67">
	<p> You nearly smash the little metal clock chimes flat with how fast you get up, the nightmare still fresh in your mind.
A bit of breakfast helps fend off the remaining images, and you sit with a book and today’s effort by Toastasaurus Rex. You also decide you couldn’t care less about the peach jelly you bought and toss it out. Max is bounding around the apartment, then hits the kitchen floor and slides into his bowl to eat his Kitty Smacks.


Your current read reminds you of your dream and you close it for a moment on your lap. To distract yourself, you look around the room. The old furniture is in good shape. The couch and single chair occupy the center and left corner of the living room. Almost every wall has a short cabinet that meets the windowsill.
There are a few plants by the window facing the deck and a pair of windows up front that have had the curtains drawn since you got here. The window to the left has the shades halfway up, letting in light and a small view of the buildings and a sliver of street from where you’re sitting. Every cabinet has a lamp or a plant. The one by the front windows has a radio with one dial for on/off and another for tuning.


You’ve gone through most of the cabinets when you moved in, but who knows if the old man left you any surprises. You feel pretty sure that even going through the whole place top to bottom, Max will dig out something you haven’t seen before years from now.


With renewed vigor you go back to the book, but after few pages in you feel like heading out, maybe taking a walk.


So go for a walk already, sheesh! 45.


Or jump out the window on 68.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap68">
	<p> CRASH! You don’t know why, you were just compelled to leap into action. You have always joked that you do your own stunts, and well, here it is. Did you forget you were on the THIRD FLOOR?!?!


Thud! You hit the second floor and roll, but the momentum takes you over that roof to the next. Thud! You land on the roof of the first floor, but you still keep going. THUD!
You hit the street after bouncing off a car parked out front, it might have been yours.


Go to 70.</p>

	<p>...aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand you’re dead.

The End.</p>

<div id="chap71">
	<p> Borden says, “I’ve had about enough of you and your smart comments!” pulling out his pistol. The barrel is pointed right in your face! You close your eyes and grit your teeth.
There’s a deafening boom and an unsettling shift in your skull. Everything goes wonky, and just as instantly, nothing.


The cavalry is called in. The Order’s vast resources are directed upon Schwenksville. By the next morning there’s no one left in the town. A few specs of what were buildings are vaguely visible from helicopter. Borden looks down then back at the grieving agent next to him and smiles, “Hey, wasn’t there a town around here?”


The End.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap72">
	<p> You can’t believe Joe is dead, dead! That agent Borden, he did this and he’s going to be coming for you next. It was a sheer stroke of luck that you escaped. Before he could get his hands on you, you fell back against a rusty panel trying to throw Max at him and it gave way, letting you roll out the brush below and out of site. From there you managed to get away without being detected. You don’t think he knows where you live, but he’s bound to find you eventually. You don’t even know where Max wound up.


These thoughts race through your mind as you pace frantically around the kitchen, trying to calm down. Mister McToast dings when you start shoving boxes and dishes around on the counter, hitting him. Furious you yank the toaster off the counter, forcing the plug out from the socket violently, and shove it all in the closest drawer leaving his cord dangling there like a broken tail. You don’t care how it’s jammed in there, “This is no time for freakin’ toast!!” you yell back.


NEXT.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap73">
	<p> You can’t fight this feeling anymore. You’ve forgotten what you started fighting for. With your tears upon floor, your toaster in the drawer. Maybe you can’t fight this feeling anymore!


Zap! The toaster’s power cord must have been damaged when you shoved it into the drawer in anger. Now instead of toast you so desperately wanted by plugging it back in, the household current running through you is turning you into toast.


 Irony! You thought he was your friend.


The End.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap74">
	<p> The mob has you! With Harriett at the lead she power walks everyone over to the edge of a cliff. Joe and you are forced to march with them. Their makeshift torches create an eerie hellish parade. They bind you and the cat together. Wrapping you in a quilt next, you then feel a rope tied around your middle as a few hands steady you. You struggle, only managing a glimpse of frantic faces and hands. You can’t tell what’s happening to Joe. You can no longer hear him. Within the darkness of your wrappings, there’s an awkward silence, leaving you with your fear. You feel your cat struggling against your body and you well up with tears. Then there’s a sudden yank and for a moment you are in a free-fall.


 Unbeknownst to them, when they tied your line to a boulder and rocked it over the side, the tether to the townsfolk from the cat pulls the entire angry mob down to the river below with you. A unified scream comes from the surprised crowd to match your own. This may be the end of you, but Max is taking everyone else with.


The End(s).</p>
</div>

<div id="chap75">
	<p> He jabs the sharp object into your arm and lets you go. He stands there watching you fall, holding the syringe in his hand.


Before the drug takes its total affect, you drift into unconsciousness and start to dream.


Mortimer couldn’t resist. The delicious flesh, the chewy innards, the way the bones crunch between his teeth. The expression on his face was like he never tasted anything so good in his entire life, especially since he was dead. “Being undead truly has its perks!” could have been on his mind, if he could have rational thoughts. There wasn’t much left of him besides his rotting form and ravenous appetite. At least you were delicious.


The End.

	<p> The sensation is irresistible and the lake just HAS to be deep enough. “Cucamonga!” is your war cry as you leap off into the air away from the cliff.
It’s a little higher than you estimated. The fear grips you, suspending time as you hover at the brink of a free fall. You try to adjust your fall to make it straight into the water, only you fail and it snaps your body back in the wrong way.


As you sink beneath the surface, the vision of the sun’s rays and clear blue sky fade to the mysteries that lie at the bottom of the lake in the darkness.


The End.</p>

<div id="chap77">
	<p> “Crazy Cat Woman was once again sighted at Schwenksville Park last week. Park goer and local fishing champion Stan Wynne ran for fear of his life as…”


It’s morning at the Cuppa Joe. Steph comes over to give his boss his first cup of the day.
Joe puts the paper down laughing at the article, “This is just too funny, who’d believe this stuff?!...Hey wait a minute?!


The End.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap78">
	<p> The morning comes once again as you stroll out of the bedroom in your faded yellow robe. Mister Toasty dings merrily and offers you his latest work, which you swear is pure genius. The sun is shining on a crisp, wonderful day.
As you sit, a cup of coffee is slid over to you along with the morning paper. Joe gives you a wink and sips. You take a sip as well through a smile. It’s rum yet raspberry flavor is a good blend, just perfect for the day ahead you think.
You scan through the articles and get to the classified section to see if there are any good sales in antiques and nostalgia, or perhaps a flea market. Then your eye moves as if on instinct to the following ad:


“Free Kitten to a loving home, playful and spunky, loves attention. Jane, Please call.”


You would have been shocked, but it feels like you just knew. Instead you smile, and a small tear forms. Max pulls his last string.


The End.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap79">
	<p> Max darts out at lightning speed, down the stairs and disappears around the front of the building. You’re still at the top of the stairs, looking down at what was once the blur of your cat’s path with awe. You figure he’s on a mission and will be back later. Its not like you scared him off, he’s just that determined. If only you could have caught him before and asked, “What’s so important?”
It could have been just something to smack around or be scratched, smelled, or the need to pee in a particular spot with no exceptions. To a cat it’s the equivalent of the end of the world.


When you get down to the bottom you look around and don’t see Max at all, you call for him but nothing happens. As you turn back the other way you bump into a guy holding the paper up while walking. “Oof, I’m sorry!”
He smiles a bit and says “Oh that’s ok…hey, haven’t I seen you somewhere before?”
“I don’t believe so, I’m new!” you say happily.
“Brand new huh? Look at you all shiny and fresh!”
You smile brightly to show that it’s just like your teeth, coming full circle with the freshness.
“Ok, you have a good day. I’m down at the Cuppa Joe if you care to stop by, name’s Joe.”
Took you a moment to realize he’s the owner didn’t you? But you tell him how cool that must be and give each other a “Cya!” and walk off in different directions.


But then, if you think Joe should come with you on some wild adventure Press 1! Err, Go to Page 87 “Hey Joe!”


But then again, you really don’t know the guy right? 
Maybe saunter over to 80.


If you’d rather be alone and go see what’s –RIGHT OVER THERE!!  85!</p>
</div>

<div id="chap80">
	<p> You see a flyer for a fundraiser and check out where they’re meeting. When you get there, several tents are set up in the parking lot of the local library. The library is looking a little worse for wear; the smell of smoke still lingers in the air. You pay for a ticket to enter, grab some cotton candy, a pretzel, a deep fried cream cookie, and a diet cola, and look around.


The tents are brightly colored. Everyone is having a good time running from tent to tent. Some have brochures while others are trying samples from the tents where local shops have set up.


There are a few tents of interest, but which one to try first?


The zebra colored tent?  Go to 88.


The Yellow tent? Go to 82.


The Green Tent? Go to 81.


The Red Tent? Go to 89.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap81">
	<p> You enter the green tent. Scoutmasters attend tables while children with their parents, as well as young couples, are looking over their brochures.
You find lots of useful maps showing trails all around the surrounding forest and some local history regarding escaped convict hideouts and occult groups performing sacrifices. The trails are all marked. This will come in very handy.


“Thanks!” You give a salute to the Scoutmaster and head out of the tent.


Go to Page 80!!</p>
</div>

<div id="chap82">
	<p> Inside the yellow tent, the sitar music and the smell of incense saturate the air filling your nose with the odors of sandalwood, jasmine, and a couple of smells you can’t actually place.
Several stacks of incense, herbs, tonics, and powders in tiny cups line the counter. The guy at the counter in his lavender lab coat and matching square shades welcomes you.
His braided ponytail sweeps back and forth behind him as he talks. “Hey, come on in and try the wares. We have an assortment of smells and tastes to get you in the right frame of mind.”
You look at all the wares; stockpile a small amount of incense and a few herb samples for dinner experiments later.
When looking over at the powders however, they are in small paper cups one might use for creamer, haphazardly spread around and not labeled.
They could be powdered creamer, sugar, or other sweeteners. Maybe even a headache powder. You just don’t know but curious all the same. You look over at the clerk, who now is bent over and busy rummaging through boxes under the table at the opposite end of the tent. He probably wouldn’t hear you anyway.


You try the closest powders. “hmmmm...”


Left? Go to 83.


Right? Go to 84.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap83">
	<p> “Well this is nice, lemony!” You add it to the pile and check out the bits you want to buy, “Thanks!”


 Back to 80.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap84">
	<p> Hmm this powder over here, as you go unnoticed by the clerk you dip your finger in and put it to your mouth, “Mmm-this tastes funny, like almonds.”
The clerk then comes over and examines the cup nervously.  “Oh no, that was Cyanide.”


“Huh??”….Goto 70.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap85">
	<p> You thought you’d start by rummaging through Jones’ General to see if he has any hidden treasures, and some soap.  As you walk in, Max runs right through your legs and up to a wicker box and starts scratching at it.
“Damn cat, shoo!” Jones says tossing a crumpled up bag at him. “You’re not getting my quilts!” To which the cat chases the crumpled bag ball around, batting it back to the front desk where Jones and a man in a suit have been engrossed in conversation. You can’t tell what the man’s saying or see his eyes behind the shades but he makes you nervous. At least he’s ignoring you. You pick up a small tin and read the label. “Prince Albert” and you give a quick snort.
“Damn, you ask a lot of stupid questions!” Jones angrily replies.
“If you want to know anything about her, she’s right over THERE!!”
The man looks at you, a menacing glare, and turns towards you. Prince Albert falls from your hand and lands with a clatter. You’re out the door before he comes to rest on the floor. You rush to the car and start it. Looking back to the man, who is caught up with something in his way. You see a puffed tail by his feet, “Stupid Cat!” he yells.
“Thanks Max!” you smile but then panic takes over and you whip away down the road.
It’s a few miles later when you relax and compose yourself, slightly. “What the..!” and pound the steering wheel. You throw yourself back into the seat and turn on the radio. Screaming ragged voices and lots of double bass accompanying heavy guitar saturate the car’s interior. You jump and are about to turn it down when you see in the rear view a brown sedan with tinted windows coming up on you at ramming speed. You accelerate and try to get away towards town. The traffic here is making it difficult and you swerve around however you can, “’Scuse me! Coming through! Get off the sidewalk!”
Somehow you don’t hit anyone, but there are a few broken potted plants, trashcans, and a sandwich board someone managed to get out of in time that won’t be the same.
The dark sedan went another way and you’ve lost him.
You slow down and take the road that cuts through the forest. You check your rear view mirror nervously hoping the sedan is not in it. Adjusting it slightly around, you do not see anything.
So being hit from the side came as a complete shock. He must have rode through the field to get you and now you’re heading into one. Quickly you dodge huge trees coming at you fast and up ahead you see a rocky outcropping. It’s too late to turn away. You’ll try to plow through, shutting your eyes. The car lifts off the ground from the rocks hitting the frame from underneath and time seems to slow down. You look out the side window to see Max sitting there on a rock watching you curiously. You return the look and then look forward in shock. The car once suspended in mid air tilts down forward and you’re falling down a steep cliff to the rocks below.


Of all the things that pass through your mind, what comes out is….


“AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!”  all the way down to 69.


“OH GOD, FOR THE LOVE BREAKFAST, SAVE ME!!” ..really?
Go to 96.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap86">
	<p> After a while of chatting up the stagehands, you stroll out of there and decide to walk around the rest of town to see what’s going on.


A block away from the town hall is the Quilting Clubhouse. You can see quilts hanging up in the windows. You stop to admire the quilts. The attention to detail on some is quite elaborate for what you once thought were just glorified blankets with patches sewn on. “Hmmm, this one looks comfy.” You remark and go over the work along it’s edges. From the edge you see it doesn’t cover the entire window, there’s a tiny sliver to see in. Inside, part of a round table is covered with huge folds of a blanket. You can’t imagine something like that being made within one’s lifetime. You make out the edge of a person in a black robe when a boney hand with a large knitting needle taps the glass hard right at your face. You jump back in surprise! The hand pinches the edge of the quilt and covers the window completely.
You hear laughter, more like a cackle, coming from inside. Images of a bubbling cauldron instead of a huge blanket come to mind.
Feeling embarrassed for being caught at your nosey-ness, you hurry along the sidewalk. The street is a busy main road, busy for a small town anyway. Old black street lamps line the street as the farmers’ tractors, 4x4s, and cars whiz by.
The next store sells electrical and plumbing. It has given the Quilting Clubhouse its space with thick shrubbery and a tall pine tree between them. Outside is a couple of old men sitting on the porch. You don’t know if they own the place or just hanging out. You’re not sure you would be welcome to shop there from the looks of it, but instead you notice a little way down across the street is the public library.
At the front of the library is a tall bronze statue of a soldier in civil war attire, or close to the period. You can’t be sure really. Every time you see one with a beard, mustache, the wide brimmed hat, and striking a triumphant pose with his sword out, you think its General Custard, and that makes you want ice cream. Damn these play on words, and its curse, which makes you hungry. You promise yourself that after a quick browse of the literary section, maybe take a few books out, you’ll get an ice cream. You get a twinge from your stomach, assuming that was gastronese for “Liar! This won’t be quick!” It knows you too well. Well, shouldn’t it?
The library is an old brick and mortar structure, which could pass for an old school house. An addition behind it is wider and has it’s own peaked roof. The front windows have been replaced with taller ones nearly the size of the walls to let in more light. As you enter, there’s a tiny lady sitting at a huge wooden desk parked just inside the door. You sign in, and are immediately given a temporary library card when you tell the lady wearing the pink button down sweater that it’s your first time here. Her glasses look to be from the 50’s. You think she is probably from the 30’s. She’s nice and points you to the interior of the library as a good place to start for newcomers.
“Why?” You ask, “New books?”
“We recently remodeled the back area, you should go see!” She smiles blindly through her thick specs, stamping the odd book, or the desk calendar by mistake.
“Ok, thanks!” You curiously turn away and head for the back.


Go to 97.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap87">
	<p>“Huh?” Joe turns back at you, wondering.
“You want to come check out the flea markets today?”
“Ok, sure. I just have to hit the ol' coffee shop along the way ok?”
You go with him down to the coffee shop, where he just opens the door, sticks his head in to say something and back out.
“Just had to tell her she was in charge.”
“Ooo such power!”
“Yah well, she's used to me running out on her. I'm not surprised she doesn't fire me instead!” he chuckles through saying.
You two make it to the flea market. The rows of cars and trucks with piles of stuff inside and on the tables lining the parking lot-now-market excite you. As you travel together along the first row, you consider going through the record collection at one table but tell yourself to hold off till you find a decent player. Who knows, there might be one here too. Good thing you talked Joe into coming. Someone has to carry all the stuff you might buy.
Row after row of clothing, baby toys, VHS tapes, and packaged As Seen On TV items bake in the sun, nothing too exciting. You break routine of going through each row to pick up some hotdogs at the van parked just outside the next row.
“Not a great turn out” you say, trying to get some relish on your dog.
“Yah, I'm getting a little bored.” Joe says.
“Well hopefully the rare and interesting items are in the next row. Then we can put them up for auction and become rich!”
“Sounds like a sure fire plan. One that is bound to succeed!”
“I thought you'd see it my way.” You take your dogs and drinks and head back into the market.


Near the end of the next row in the shade is a table full of more exotic items. Buddha statues, small water features, clothing made from camel or llama hair, and strange plants. They are all very colorful and have vibrant blooms. Some have long sharp thorns. You pick up one and try to figure out what it is. You recognize this from somewhere, perhaps a nature show about plants from the rainforest. But you can't remember if this is the plant whose points are coated in a strong toxin, capable of being fatal.


“Hey Joe, Do you know what kind of thing this -OW!”


Go to 70.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap88">
	<p> The sign says Cuppa Joe and you can smell the coffee. With excitement you enter and find a lone girl wearing a tan outfit and matching visor is patiently waiting for customers.
She greets you and offers some small samples try. You go through about 10 different samples before making a purchase of a Big Cuppo Cuppa.  No one else has come in the whole time. “Isn’t this a little quiet?” You ask, looking around inside the tent. She smiles sadly, “Yah, we don’t get a lot of business but he says we need the exposure. I wish he’d give me some exposure.”
You slightly cough, “Uh what?” There’s definitely something on her mind.
She sighs “I’ve been doing this crummy job for over a year now and not once has he really noticed me…and I’m the only employee!”
“Who doesn’t notice?”
She sighs, “Joe Cuppa, the owner. Sure he’s my boss, but I like him. I don’t think he can tell, and I get so nervous around him, I can’t tell him.”
“Do you think he likes you?” You take a seat near the table of samples.
She sighs, “He might, he always gives me a wink and trusts me with the store, but I dunno. He always seems more interested in what he’s reading to pay me any attention. I mean, I’ve been going to work every day, I never complain. I go home and I tell my mom what a great guy Joe is, but she doesn’t listen to me. Then I wash my uniform every day. In the shower I’m thinking about the store, what I’m doing. I come in and I set up the menus, I try to come up with new flavors, I clean the counters, volunteer to stay late, taking bean bag inventory, locking up some nights…..” the girl tells her story, sigh, going on and on in excruciatingly boring detail….As she talks you put your head back, mouth open, jutting out your tongue to the slow thralls of agony. You feel the flesh on your body tighten, harden and crack like old leather, the bones becoming brittle. Once vibrant red hair becoming thin and gray, falling to the floor. The soft orbs that were once your eyes, now dull and hazy, becoming shrunken and hard. You have never been so bored it is literally killing you...


Go to 69.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap89">
	<p> You enter the Red Tent through a series of opaque drapes and a warning that you must be 18 or over to enter. Inside is a collection of very naughty items such as books, videos, and novelties. With your interest piqued, you waltz over the table. Of the boxes of usual faire, there’s one labeled “The Dreaded Apparatus – a contortionist’s fantasy!” You’ve always considered yourself quite limber and a bit of a daredevil so why not. The sleazy man at the register gives you a knowing look but all you can do it try to ignore it. Thankfully the items are in pristine shape and none look previously used or opened.


That night you set it up according to the directions, “Ok, a leg here. Left arm there, and pull this over my head. Ok. Ready set go!” You turn on the power. The device tightens, at first the sensation is quite pleasing but the pressure does not stop, it only increases, painfully. Its circuits fried and there’s no way to get out of it to pull the plug from the wall. It slowly pulls your appendages to the point of breaking. You feel the socket in your right shoulder shudder then the arm becomes dislodged. Then your left leg is pulled back past your head farther than seems possible and you can feel the flesh tearing. Your screams become silent as the loop you put over your head drops to your neck and squeezes tightly. You quickly try to think of a ways out of the situation, but doubt finding the receipt right now to be one of them.


So go to 69.</p>
</div>


<div id="chap90">
	<p> After a few cups of Joe, Joe is walking you home. You start to think about the neighborhood watch meeting again. “How does Harriett think there’s a threat coming from me and my cat?”
“I don’t know, she probably has her ear bent by those old ladies in that knitting club.”
“Do you knit a quilt? Certainly not crochet?”
”Bah, it’s that needle and thread stuff. If I can’t glue or weld it back together I break out the duct tape.”
Max comes running down to greet you at the bottom of the stairs.”
“Hey Smax, I didn’t realize you were out. Get anything good?”
“He’s just glad you’re back so you can give him something.” And he winks.
“Well if that’s why you walked me here, all I have is hot and sweet…”, then you back pedal a bit, “…and a little crunchy.”
“Heh, whoah you had me going there for a second.”
“Well yah I, only can offer toast, not ready to dive into the full course.”
”That’s ok, I’m good.” Joe all ready starts to back up, “I like hanging out with you and I hope to see you again.”
”Me too.” You re-assure him.
You both give each other a smile and part ways. You call to Max on your way upstairs but he is content to sit on the sidewalk and watch Joe go back towards the shop.
You go into the house and put some toast together, all that talk created a craving.


On the sidewalk sits Max. The streetlight above becoming his personal spotlight. A figure creeps out of the shadows before him. His dark hat and gray trench coat covers his features. Max looks at him quizzically and their eyes lock. Max doesn’t break his stare, cats normally don’t, but the creeper is mesmerized by it and can’t move. The cat’s stare locks into him behind his eyes, holding onto his mind with ethereal claws.
The cat then makes a small movement forward, and the man falls back as if pushed. The fall breaks the spell and he goes running off.
Max returns to his playful self and bounds up the decks and scratches on the door incessantly to be let in. “Mow?”
“All right Max, what is it?”


A circle of elderly women knitting a large blanket together on a table, sit quietly working when the man bursts in. He pauses for a moment and corrects his posture, taking off his hat and trench coat. Still a bit shaken, he calms himself as much as he can before speaking to the group.
“Ladies, I’ve come to report what I’ve seen. I took the liberty of keeping an eye on that woman Jane and her cat as was suggested. Well, her cat intervened.”
“What’s this?” Says one lady, completing her row and tying it into her neighbor’s with freakish speed before stopping to listen.
“She has that cat, he’s magic or something. I could feel him reach into my head and push me away!”
“Aw, you’re exaggerating dear. Why don’t you go home and rest now, we’ll deal with this news. Thank you Howard.”
When he leaves the ladies resume knitting, the fervent clicking of the needles is the only sound for a moment. “He’s tainted now.” One of the women says. The larger of the women says, “Yes, we’ll deal with him in due time. Let’s get Harriett to rally the troops. We’ll bring her into the fold.”
The rest of them nod, “It’s been long enough, the time is now.” Says another.
A thin woman points menacing with a knitting needle to the center of the circular blanket, its medallion surrounded by a pattern of knots. “That creature should be destroyed!” her raspy voice commands.
“Agreed, we knew there would be a day when the beast would reveal itself. Oh dark sisters, let us free our master from its unworthy vessel.” Any one hearing the laughter coming from the Quilting Clubhouse at this hour would find it quite unsettling.


In the morning, Harriett receives a call. She listens intently. Her happy, cheery disposition slides down to a grim expression. She hangs up and marches into her bedroom. With renewed focus and determination, she grabs a fresh jogging suit from the closet. “This is going to be a fine morning.”


Go to 92.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap92">
	<p> Max and you are in the middle of an argument. He’s convinced the rope to your bathrobe belongs exclusively to him, while you debate the point that it comes with the robe, which is yours, and therefore not his.
He insists, pointing out that the end of the rope is accessible and he can grab it. According to cat law that means it belongs to him.
You site that his cat law is merely a misinterpretation of the owner-pet relations contract, which in this case takes precedence. Where by the owner entitles the pet the privilege of “playing” with the owner’s possessions, but does not entitle the pet to ownership. Said owner may remove the item from the pet at any time.
Max remains firm on his standing however, leaving his claw attached to the rope while you explain the lengthy legal limitations of ownership and due process.
You’re surprised you’ve held a debate with a cat this long and he’s still keenly focused on you, and on having the rope.
“Max, I hereby swing the other end of the rope at your face, thus distracting you enough to release you from the binds of your former engagement.” To which Max seems thoroughly excited that there was another end to this rope. Open mouthed and batting at it frantically. With a quick jerk you turn, the ends no longer exist in his view and you assume he’s completely confused when he walks off.
He on the other hand, knows he’s won and will simply have the rope later at his convenience. Both ends.


You go out after the usual breakfast, shower, and quick change to a jeans-tee-sneakers combo. Max comes with you, scampering around your feet.
You decide to take a walk around the block, see what’s out there. You meet a few people along the way, walking in groups in dark clothing. You say ‘Hi!”, but the most you get is a polite nod. Looking back around you notice some of them were from the neighborhood watch meeting with –“Oh hi Harriett, how are you doing?” you say nearly stumbling into her, “ I didn’t see you there.”


“Hello Jane. Out for a walk with your cat I see.” Its not exactly her usual happy tone. She appears to using that as a mask for a more serious one, and harboring an inner sadness. “Yes, I suppose.” Is the only reply you have to offer.
“Do you mind if we walk together? I wanted to talk to you about something.” And she leads on in her white jogging suit.
“You know, I’m really sorry I put you on the ‘hit list’ for the neighborhood watch.”
“I’m not sure what you mean.” You ask, knowing full well what she had done.
“When we had the watch meeting, I had a list of potential issues that should be addressed. One was the problem I had with them releasing the burglar, that neighbor of the Lackeys. Then the issue with the fire at the library, I’ve checked in on both this morning after a meeting I had with the ladies of the quilting club.” She sighs and continues; “Now the neighbor, the Lackeys, the janitor, and the suspect in the arson are all dead or missing.” You can’t believe what you’re hearing. Harriett takes a deep breath, and then halts you when you both reach a dense garden just outside the neighborhood.
“That leaves my third point. I wanted them to keep an eye on you and your cat. I know now, like I suspected, that you were up to something.”
“Really? I had no idea.” You say sarcastically, near ready to punch good ol’ Healthy Harriett in the face.
She leans in with a look, “I know you know of this. I saw you in the back with some man, who was he?”
“What, you don’t know something now?”
“Never mind, we’ll deal with him in good time.”


A dark figure comes out of nowhere suddenly, blocking your vision.
You are knocked to the side and fall to the ground. From your low vantage point, you now see a net has ensnared Max and he is being drug into the brush. You can hear a few muffled laughs. Some are of old women. One says, “lets take him to the ritual site now! We mustn’t wait!”
You try to get up, but the attack has made you groggy and you struggle to stay conscious. You can’t focus as you’re being picked up, then you black out.


The cool breeze of the evening revives you. You wake up in a lawn chair on the deck outside your apartment. The town is quiet. The night sky has an amazing clarity to it. You jerk yourself into the upright position, immediately your head starts pounding and you hold on to the chair until it subsides.


“Where did they go with Max? What ritual site? You think about Harriett and the laughter. Remembering what she said, you rush down as quickly as you can to your car and drive into town and up on to the sidewalk in front of the Quilting Clubhouse. Darting out of the car and throwing yourself at the door. The door does not budge, even after repeated tries. You sit at the steps and cry for your cat and what the mad townsfolk will probably do. You get back up and peer through the windows, looking around when there’s a voice behind you.
”Did you know you need to curb your car when walking it on the sidewalk?”
Joe stands there smiling and a little perplexed but you rush over to him and hug him hard.
“Oof! Thanks, you ok?”
“They took Max! Those freakin’ quilting…Harriett…those...b-witches!”
“Hold on, the quilting club has your cat? Are they going to hurt him?”
You relay what happened this afternoon, “…and they think he’s the cause of all the bad things that was happening here!”
“Crap! So where are they?”
”I don’t know! They’re not in there, not even their quilts, just some pictures of the park on the walls.”
Joe imagines a bunch of old ladies having a barbeque with Max, “Heh… oh no. The park! The cliff! The first settlers used to have groups of nomads traveling the area. They found out they were practicing black magic, sacrifices!”
“What?!?!”
“Oh man, lets go!” You and Joe pile into your car, whipping it into a 180 and speed off towards the park. Thank your racer genes.


Go to 94! </p>
</div>

<div id="chap94">
	<p> Your little car does not have 4-wheel drive! So you stop trying to ride through the park to reach the cliff. Before the cliff is an open field and a procession of torch bearing individuals assembling there. It looks like the entire neighborhood watch has joined in and they’re in some kind of trance. Your cat hangs on a pole, trapped in a net.
“Harriett!!” You scream. She turns around and threatens you.
“You are the one! You have kept the beast trapped in this pitiful vessel, you and Mister Qiaokeli! All this time! We will destroy this form and reclaim the master’s power for ourselves!!”
“Give me back my cat!!” You and Joe run at the crowd. Joe makes a sideways dive and tackles a few at the same time. You run up to the pole bearer and give him a swift knee to the groin, which is enough to get to the netted Max. You grab him tightly and run away, looking back to see if Joe is following you. Several people have piled upon Joe, their weight bringing him down to the ground. He yells “GO!” but you stand there, stunned.


A moment later, he is bound and held fast. Harriett tells you to come back and his life may be spared.


You go back. Go to 74.


You run. See Jane Run. Go to 95.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap95">
	<p> You start to back away, not sure if you can bear leaving Joe to these monsters. He wants you to be safe. You’re feelings for him, for his safety, “Its not fair!”
Sirens and floodlights suddenly burst into existence as Police SUVs come charging into view.


A dozen cops come out and start pulling the mob apart and setting Joe free. He then comes running over to you and helps untangle Max from the net. Max is more than glad to be free and goes bounding around. You also glance over to a few of the watch members as they trip and fall over as while being led to the police vehicles. The old ladies look at you warily.


A cop and Mister Jones come over to you and finding that you're ok, ask you what happened. You tell them the story about what they're up too and how you found out. Jonesy says, ”I knew they were no good, damn witches. Even that damn Agnes!” he grumbles, making a fist. He points a bony hand at one of the old ladies in the group. “She had played my brother and me for years! Toying with our affections! I’m glad we got to see the end of them!” He spits on the ground in disgust.


“So who tipped you off?” You ask, still feeling tense from all the excitement.

”That man over there, he works for the government or something. He’s not looking so good.” By the trees is the agent in his dirty suit, leaning up against one of the trees in the darkness.

	<p> BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP!


The alarm buzzer goes off, ruining your sleep as usual but this time you're actually glad for it. Aside from pulling you out of your nightmare, it’s the start of a new chapter in your life.
You toss the alarm clock in the trash. You’ve grown to hate that sound and it’s not welcome anymore.


You're moving. Today is the last day you have in your city apartment. Everything you own has been consolidated down to enough bags all ready crammed into your car.
Your aunt would disapprove. She has time and time again stuck her nose into your business about how things are managed in a “normal life”.  Getting out of here will put some much-needed space between you and her. You also can't wait to get out of town in general. Too expensive to be so noisy and crowded, everyone angry at each other over nothing “what's the point?” you ask yourself. To be fair, you have had some good times. It’s just the day-to-day frantic lifestyle catching up to you. Now that it’s caught up, time to give it the slip.
The first thing you do is take a shower and then grab the hair dye. You want everything to be new, even the color of your hair. You work your way out of the bathroom putting everything either into your backpack or into the trash bag and make your way into the living room where you slept on a sleeping bag since you sold or trashed all your furniture. You roll up the bag, and work towards the kitchen. The toaster is still plugged in. Inspired, you open up the fridge door. It’s a shame you didn't save any bread for just one more morning of toast before heading out. Only the carton of OJ remains. You take the last few swigs and toss it in the trash. You spray and wipe down all the insides and outsides of the kitchen, then yank the toaster from the wall socket and tuck him under your arm.


You spend a moment looking around, remembering the life you’ve had in the city. Now you set your thoughts forward to where you're going. This reminds you of the dream you had. “That was a crazy dream. I guess I’m just a little nervous about moving. [Yawn], I should go check that apartment way out in Schwenksville.  C’mon Muffy McToastmitbutter!”


Your cell phone rings, “Hello? Oh….Hi Aunt Stace….”


Go to 2.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap97">
	<p> The whole interior is not like what you expect. The brick is less pronounced on the inside, only peeking out between a large round timber frame at the beginning of its interior. You assume the front with just its half dozen bookshelves and Pinky’s (you’ve named her so) desk was the whole library until they remodeled.
Bookshelves run along the curved walls, but also make rows in the middle, breaking into sections according to category. Tables break up the sections for study and research. Along the far end is another section that’s closed.
“Is this the back or is that the back, or the back-back?” You wonder.
You wander around the sections, look for an author you might recognize, snag a few that promise to be “spine tingling!”, working your way back, to the back.


You figure no one is really paying attention, so if this is wrong at least you might not get caught. You simply can’t help yourself. After all, Pinky said the back had something to offer. Who are you to deny it?


As you stand there pondering, a woman’s voice from behind asks. “Can I help you with something?” She’s a medium build about your height with gray hair pulled back into a bun. Parts of the bun have freed themselves and have fallen forward, giving her a friendly, soft appearance.
“No, I was just looking around. I haven’t been in this library before, so I’m not sure if there’s more to see. I’m interested in old rare books, is that what’s behind there?”
She glances over and smirks, “Well they’re old but hardly rare, and not worth your time unless you like drunken old men.”


“Ah. Well do you recommend anything about the history of Schwenksville?”
“Formerly Schmedleyville for some reason, until the town was fully settled, though some may disagree on what one calls settled. It has a dark past.”
“Really, that sounds interesting!”
“I suppose to a new comer like yourself, but we prefer not to indulge one’s interest in the subject. Can I interest you in some non-fiction perhaps? Something where the consequences of one’s investigations aren’t as severe?” She says, looking at you with a raised brow.


“I’m sure I’ll find something, thanks.” You give her a sly smile with the response. She eyes you suspiciously and then returns a pleasant smile and walks away, leaving you still facing the door to the back-back. “Hmmm…”


“Old drunken guys eh? I’m there!” Go to 105.


You think about the last time you were being nosy. NEXT.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap98">
	<p> You poke around the library, trying to keep an eye on the older woman who ‘helped’ you earlier, hoping not to raise suspicion. You coax a few history books from the shelves when she’s not looking and stroll back to the non-fiction when she does. Doing the old book-in-a-book technique you read what could be found about the town. Turns out the town’s name was what she said originally during its early lumbering years, and you remember the mayor mentioned the nomadic people, who according to the research eventually settled nearby. Scanning what you can, you found that when more of the area was cleared away, the new settlers, once nomadic, demanded they establish a park as a means of keeping some of the forest intact to save Mother Nature was their plea. What was later discovered were bodies found in ritual sacrifice. Some diagrams of the crimes were written here along with occult symbols.


Another book notes construction of the park and the older buildings around, some include pictures. One in particular is a group of women in long gowns that were once considered casual wear. The ladies are holding up a long blanket, and the title of the picture is ‘The newly formed Women’s Quilting Association’.
In the center of the blanket is one of the occult symbols from the diagrams, looking similar to a demon’s head. You check the dates between the picture and the history of the town’s early settlement. They are 40 years apart. You realize that they never got rid of these witches.


Its creepy to think that this may still be going on. You try to rationalize that they probably aren’t into to sacrifices anymore, this is a modern world now. They are more likely to just sit around and say “Devil-this” and “Darkness-that” and file their taxes like everyone else.


You slide the books away from where you were, and collect the novels you originally pulled out and head up to Pinky. Along the way, the woman from before puts a hand on you gently. She apologizes for coming off rather harsh and gives you a card, “I’m heading there soon. You are welcome to visit my friends and me if you like. We’re always welcoming new blood.”  You thank her and check out your books with Pinky –STAMP!


Outside the library you’re rubbing the top of your hand where Pinky slammed it with her rubber stamp. You look around, and then remember the card you were given.
It says The Quilting Clubhouse along with the address and her name, Agnes.
You check your watch. Its not that late, so you might check it out.
According to Pinky, you’re also due back in 3 days.


As you stand there, your stomach reminds you of the deal and you go off to get some ice cream.


NEXT </p>
</div>

<div id="chap99">
	<p> You find a large penguin just a block away from the library, his belly open with people standing inside, handing out his innards, his tasty creamy frozen innards.


With the artificial sugar rush from the Pengo-Ice, you stroll back over to the Quilting Clubhouse and go in. You may find out just how far these ladies take their so-called ‘occult meetings’


The air is stale and the fluorescent lighting takes a little while to adjust too. Some of the bulbs need replacing. You can see now that quilts line all the wood paneled walls and there’s a heap of a blanket on top of the table with everyone around it in black robes. One woman is frantically knitting when a large woman puts a hand on her to stop.


“Ah, I see Agnes has brought another to come see our quilts. Please, feel free to look around.”
You feel a little awkward by having eight women sit around and stare at you while you look at their handy work. A few don’t look too pleased you’re even breathing in their stale air. You put your hand up to one hanging against the wall opposite the windows and hear what could be a muffled hiss from someone behind you. You keep making your way around in silence, hands at your side, wondering if you should say anything, offer to purchase one, or just thank them and walk out. “These are nice, the work is more detailed than I imagined. Are these all made by you?” You stand at the head of the table now, furthest away from the door with the covered windows to your left.
“All by our little club, yes. Some go back to the very beginning.” Says the larger of the women. She has an air of authority about her.


“Oh you mean the Women’s Quilting Association?” Go to 100.


“Really, How long ago was that?” Go to 102.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap100">
	<p> Agnes crosses her arms and nods towards you in speaking to the others, “she’s been reading the books at the library.”
“Well then, perhaps you would like to learn more about our club?”
“Yes I would. It sounds like something I could really get into.”
”She’s persistent, I can tell you that much.” Agnes remarks to the leader.
The larger woman comes over to you. “I’m Marge Wynne and I head the group here. We dabble in our craft to continue the traditions passed down from our mothers and theirs before, and to our children.” She pulls back the folds of the blanket to reveal it more clearly. It’s composed of interweaving lines that appear random at first, but taking in the whole reveals some type of pattern to it all. At its center is the demon head symbol you recognize from the picture. The blanket has grown much since then. She continues, “We were once part of a larger group, men and women, taking a cue from the mythology that everyone’s fate was weaved into a Tapestry of Life. Since women were at the time supposed to do such domestic things, we were given the task of making it ourselves while the men spouted their knowledge and gave the direction. We would follow strict guidelines and live according to them in order to make our tapestry mirror our lives. It was the hope that one day we could create threads that we could control. There was conflict however. We disagreed with the men. We wanted to do this our way. We were the ones making the tapestry, we knew best! The arguments lasted for years, much blood was split and eventually the men were never seen again. We remained and became the very foundation of the town!” She allows her excitement to calm and continues.
“So we meet regularly, to knit this “tapestry” in remembrance of our sisters and the struggle they made to free themselves from an oppressive lifestyle.”
”That’s nice. So no human sacrifices or wild orgies like the good old days huh?” you chuckle.
“I don’t think any of us would be up for an orgy at this age.” The ladies giggle at the idea. Some look on confused, hoping another will tell them what one is.
“We do some re-enactments to show respect to our heritage, but you have to be a member to participate. Would you like to join?”
“Sure!” You say. They’re nice and no one’s getting sacrificed. It could be fun.
They welcome you gracefully and you learn a little about knitting and crocheting in the next couple of hours.


In the evening you gather with your “dark sisters” and march together to the park, taking a path that stays mostly out of view. A few people see you but they divert their eyes or cross streets quickly. You find it hilarious.
Once at the park you meet another group in dark robes that joins yours, some are men.
“A necessary evil.” Agnes says to you with a wink, which you return making a gun gesture with your hand. “Gotcha.”
You’re all the way in the back, and follow the procession through a path in the park leading to a cliff side. Cool breezes whip along as everyone spreads out to a circular formation. The blanket is brought by six members struggling to bring it to the center. Another six come over and unfold the blanket, letting it take its circular shape. You see the devil head medallion clearly. A primitive round head, with triangular points to be what you assume are the horns.


Another six brings someone forward with a velvet bag over his head and lays him down on the blanket. He struggles for a moment then suddenly stops, looking content to lie there with arms and legs outstretched.
You are bumped sideways, removing your vision from the centerpiece and you pick up the pace. Eventually the chanting and movements become familiar enough for you to join in. You can’t stop laughing.


One breaks from the crowd towards the center and removes the man’s hood. He looks early 30’s, wavy dark hair, dressed in a black shirt and jeans. He doesn’t seem able to speak. He scans the pseudo-cult members and locks his look on you. The tension of the chanting builds and from your right you are handed a large knife and moved out into the center. The chanting and motion is intoxicating, so you can’t help gyrating your way over to the center where the “victim” is. Swaying above him, your arms outstretched, you show the dagger to the sky above. The chant grows louder, the blanket seems to be catching the light of the torches, pulsing and illuminated as if alive.
You look down at the man below you and feel his pulse through your feet on the blanket. The sensation takes you over. You kneel down on top of him and thrust the dagger into his chest. You both look at each other in shock and you jump up in terror of the realization. You see his blood flow out of his chest and into the rug as fine lines like thread. In a dream like vision he appears to completely unravel and become part of the rug. Your terror is replaced by the unexpected surge of energy running up through your feet to your head. It’s exhilarating!! You laugh in delight of the power, you’re one with the power! The other women laugh, the older ones cackle in unison with you.


Go to 103.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap102">
	<p> “Since this item was made.” she says, folding back the heap to reveal the head of a demon. You’re pushed on to it, the larger woman’s weight is far more than you can resist, you feel the rest of them moving the blanket around you, securing your arms and feet. They leave you there in the dark folds, unable to move. You can still make out their incessant cackling. Over an hour passes by and you start to feel faint. Not much air is getting to you. The weight and the warmth with the lack of oxygen eventually overwhelm you and you pass out.
You awake to cool fresh air blowing across your face. You’re lying on your back, looking up at the night sky. Were it not for the group of twenty or more individuals in robes bearing torches, you’d be quite content to relax on the comfy blanket.


You try to get up but are bound by threads running all along your body.
“They’ve somehow sewn me into the blanket?” You wonder. As they dance around you and chant, your heartbeat begins to pulse through the fibers. You can feel the pulse through out your entire body along the threads themselves. Its as if the blanket is now alive with your life force.
A figure comes over and hovers above you swaying to the rhythm of their chant. She lowers herself slowly upon you, into a kneeling position. At the climax of their chanting, she removes a crooked dagger from within her robe. The loose folds reveal a bright jogging suit. Before you can scream, the blade is thrust into your chest and you gasp, breathing in only fibers of the blanket that start to dig and pull at you in every direction.
The tearing is painful beyond belief then eventually subsides. You’re becoming part of the blanket; threads composed of your flesh displaying a new line in a pattern of intertwined others. That is your lifeline coming to an end, and as power for the group.
You drift from consciousness to the void beyond, feeling nothing at all.

The End.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap103">
	<p> The next morning you awake at the clubhouse within a pile of robes, still feeling the effects of the power that had run rampant through you last night. You straighten yourself up and freshen up in their bathroom. Coming out, you see one of them in the other room, not sure which one.  “Good morning dark sisters!” You say in a sleepy sing songy way.
”I beg your pardon?” Says a woman in a bright jogging suit.
“Oh I’m sorry, I thought you were…you’re Harriett right?”
“Yes I think we met the other day. I usually come by on my morning walk to clean, the ladies can be so messy. I have no idea how they manage to make such a mess making a quilt.”
You look at her, smile knowingly, searching for that telltale sign that says she knows exactly why, but there is none.
“I swear. Sure, my mother used to clean up after me as a kid, now I’m cleaning up after her? I could be out doing my walk.” She says while frantically putting everything back into order.
“You’re mother?”
“Yes, Marge Wynne? She heads the quilting club. She says I could join but I’m not ready yet. I see you have, and I’m older than you. At least she gives me access here if I need it. More likely when she needs me to clean.”
“Hey, no need to get grumpy about, I’m sure you’ll be IN in no time!”
“Well thanks.” Harriett says sarcastically and puts some final things in order and leaves without saying goodbye.
You stretch out the last kinks and stroll out as well. You didn’t see anyone else and decide to close the door on the way out, which it locks. You head across town past the library and look in. You don’t see anyone. It must still be early. Around back you see a large plume of smoke and rush around quickly.


Two men sit alone by a makeshift barbeque grill behind the library, the area is scattered with junk and building debris they must have gathered into a pile after the remodeling was done. One of them is in blue coveralls, while another is in tan.
They’re both sitting around, trying to keep themselves upright and drink from a bottle they share. The smoke from the teetering grill makes you cough, and they suddenly notice you there. The one in tan falls over. The tan one on the floor yells, “Hey Stan, we have company!” pointing up at the sky.
Stan waves you over and offers you the bottle, which you decline. The two let you join in on the barbeque, even though they probably didn’t realize the meat is far far past dead and just embers now. You stand there shaking your head.
The one in tan crawls back up to his seat and waves for the bottle. “Here you go Bud.” Bud takes a swig from the bottle and starts in on Stan.
“You know what your problem is? Agnes. She rides you like a pack mule, all you do is carry her sh- “
“Hey!” Stan hits Bud in the shin with a rock. Bud throws the bottle, clearly going the wrong way and shatters against the grill. The spray of alcohol and burning embers hit the debris and the library, which catches on fire!


You see Stan and Bud run off in opposite directions. You run to the nearest phone booth and call the fire department.


Luckily the fire department comes and puts out the fire before it severely damages the exterior. Agnes approaches you as you watch them go. “What in the world happened?”
”Stan and Bud happened. They were having a drunken barbeque out back and nearly cost you the library!”
“I’ll tell the police. I don’t want you getting in the middle. This is actually an old and ongoing problem.”
“Couldn’t we…?” you ask, making a suggestive gesture to last night.
“No, not at this time anyway. I realize what you’re feeling but all in good time my dear. Why don’t you take a break? I hear there’s a coffee shop down by the town hall.”
“Good idea, I’ll come by later tonight then?”
“Ok.” And Agnes gives you a sweet smile as you walk off towards the coffee.


On the way you catch the anniversary activities held at the town hall’s courtyard. The kiosks of food are enticing so you grab some sausage sandwiches for breakfast and slam them down. The stagehands see you walking and dancing to the band while eating sausages across the compound and the give a few whistles. You notice and give them a wink and continue munching along to the music. “Necessary evil…” you sing in improv to the music between bites.
The coffee shop is called Cuppa Joe. It works since some call you Jo. So this must be your kind of shop. Covering the window is a “Happy Birthday Schmedleyville!” banner. Getting the joke, you take it now a little personal and move it out of the way to get to the door. Taped to the inside of the door is a sign, ‘Going out of Business.’


You walk in and look around. The shop is very brown, everything is either brown or tan, and none of the cups match. “Well now I can see why…” you make your way to the counter. The girl tells you that all the money is going to a funeral for the owner who was found dead last night.
“Aw. I’m sorry to hear that.” You look away, remembering visions of last night and you might not want her to see the expression on your face. You straighten up and make an order. As she hands you the steaming cup you ask, “So what is going to happen to this place?”
“Oh I think it will be sold, the landlord will probably try to unload it cheap.”
“Well that’s unfortunate. Can you tell me how to reach him?”
Slightly stunned, she gives you the number and slides over their cordless phone.
You call the landlord and express your deepest sympathy, then set up a meeting.


Within no time, after calling in a few favors and getting an advance from one client, you revamp the coffee shop to your liking. You invite the ladies over to your new place to come and have free brews at The Wicca Café. Their drinks are free. The others must pay, dearly. Mwahahahahahahahaha!


The End-cackle.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap105">
	<p> The back-back is a utility room, full of paper bundles, boxes, cleaners, mops, a sink, the circuit breakers, and another door to the outside that’s open. You can hear two men slurring out an argument.
“Well you like Agnes don’tcha? Always fighting with your brother over that one!”
The other in blue coveralls then says, “And for some reason you like em with pink sweaters and bad vision, but then again, you ugly! Haha!” They both laugh and stagger around.
“Hey fellas! What’s going on?”
They yell “HEY!” and welcome you to the party. A minute or so into it and you have downed a few swigs of the scotch being past around and you’re feeling pretty good. Over the next couple of hours, they talk about every thing that comes to mind. The one in blue coveralls is Stan Jones, the younger brother by a year of Peter, the owner of Jones’ General who most people their age call Pete “Jonesy”. Mostly because he hates it. He’s also the custodian of the library and try as he might, there’s not a whole lot to do. The women usually chase him out till he’s needed. Fortunately his buddy, Bud in the tan coveralls, comes to keep him company. He owns the run down gas station across the adjacent street, which you can almost see through the debris and high weeds from the back lot they’ve set up camp at. He doesn’t get more than a car or two to fix a month, most of the revenue comes from the pumps and snacks and he’s got a clerk that can handle it or he gets on the PA and yells for Bud to come back.
They’ve got a nice set up you think, lets them get drunk and rowdy without bothering anyone. You’re feeling quite tipsy yourself by now, ”Say, what did you say about Agnes Bud? Stan’s into her huh?”
“She trouble! I keep telling him that. His brother Pete knows the score!”
“What’s that??”
“She’s a witch! Evil as all hell, you can hear them cackling over at the quilting place most nights.” You go there when its dark, you’ll see!”
“Really? I should go check that out, old ladies are always up to something.”
“Damn right!” Bud says, pointing somewhere in your direction with his eyes closed.
Stan tosses an empty bottle at Bud, “Shut up Bud! You…you…don’t have a qu-clue.” Stan slumps over a pile of junk and starts screwing parts of it together. “Now, help me make this grill and we’ll get some ribs for later.”
“You can barely walk!” You say with a slight wobble as you stand. You offer to get the ribs as thanks for letting you party with them. They agree, knowing that they can’t do much more today, and it’s getting dark.


You head out for the ribs, it’s a bit of a walk when you’re not sober but evenshully you get to the grocers and buy steaks.
On the way back to the library you come up to the Quilting Clubhouse and hear voices inside. You leave the steaks on the sidewalk and walk up the steps.
You burst in, standing there in front of a handful of women knitting. In the center is a huge blanket. You point at every one of them “I know what you are, everyone in this town knows! You’re all a witch! And I’m going to expose you for what you are!” 
You stagger over to the blanket and fall on top of it. Its warm and cozy, you close your eyes and want to fall asleep. You feel a hand and you suddenly realize why you’re there.
You jerk yourself awake, pulling the blanket up into your hands with surprising strength. Staggering backwards with the blanket you head for the door. You turn to go down the steps and you’re poked by a knitting needle, the ladies yelling angrily at you. You tune them out but in trying to leave you misjudge the first step and go stumbling down into a man below.
“Oof!” He says. You can only make out his brown suit from the exposed limbs under the blanket as you manage to get up. With the ladies at the doorway and the man under the blanket you see a parked car with its door open and engine running.


Max? I almost forgot, what are you doing here? Go to 107.

Oops, I forgot the steaks!! Got to 110.</p>
</div>

<div id="chap107">
	<p> Your cat’s tail is showing from the top of the blanket. You help the man up as the women pull the blanket away and back into their clubhouse, slamming the door and locking it. Guess you won’t be allowed back in there. This has been a sobering moment.
The man gets up, still holding onto Max. You suddenly recognize him as the man near town hall who asked you some questions earlier.
“I see you found my cat.” You go to reach for him but the man doesn’t let you.
“Ma’am, um Jane is it?  My name is Gary, I’m an agent with…well we need to talk about your cat. Could you get in the car please?”
You agree hesitantly, but you also want to get out of here, and you want Max back.
When you both get in he hands you Max and starts driving. He tells you what he saw down by the fountain. You’re surprised, you thought you left him in the apartment. “Cat’s are tricky” you admit to yourself.
“I had lost him at the fountain, so I made my way to where you lived and he was right there. Because of my training and nature I suppose, he let me take him. Either that or it was because he knew I was bringing him to you.”
You chuckle, but stranger things have happened so it could be true.
“Look, this next part is going to sound weird,” Gary continues,” but this cat of yours is part of a bigger problem, and he’s not exactly a cat either.”
“Whhaaaaat?” You don’t know if you heard him right, the buzz is either from what he said or the alcohol in your system.
“My agency, The Order, they created Max there. Though they weren’t too sure it was going to come out so cute and fluffy. However, they called it The Nexus, and it’s a tiny tiny piece of what you would call Fate.”
”I don’t believe in that, we make our own choices.”
”True, but if there is an intelligent design to every particle in the universe that we make choices upon, well this little cat of yours is a fragment of it.”
You shake your head and gaze out the window; you can see he’s reached town hall and heading towards the businesses nearby. In this direction he could head out of town. You continue to listen, “He doesn’t fully control your fate, but you can get influenced or even pushed if he gets excited. Here, watch…um may I?” Gary slows down and extends a hand toward the cat. You loosen your grip and the cat comes over to him. Gary pulls over and then goes into a meditative state moving the cat around like some kind of gun, his legs dangling in the air. When Gary opens his eyes, he and Max are staring intently out the windshield at a man standing outside the Cuppa Joe coffee house. The man with dark wavy hair, a black shirt and jeans is sipping coffee out of a bowl mug, watching the traffic go by. You look back at Gary and he gives Max a quick jostle, Max corrects himself sharply and you look back at the man. He jostles the same way, spilling coffee all over his shirt. Gary, now exhausted, lets Max go and he comes back to your lap. “Whew, I…I..didn’t know if I could do that. Just meditating like that, and then with Max, I thought that’s what the training was about.”
“What the?” is all you can muster.
“Granted, its not like that’s the only thing he’s meant to do, that’s more of a side effect I think. Actually, I think The Order would rather be able to direct Fate itself, steer mankind in a positive direction, end war and such.”
“…with a cat?”
”Like I said, he’s a fragment of the whole, the energy manifesting into some shape. He could have been a lamp. They really wanted full access; I think that was too much. He really should go back into the fold where he belongs.” Gary resumes driving, you watch the man attempt to clean himself off and scratch his head in bewilderment.
Gary takes you out of Schwenksville and onto the main road, then pulls over into a private driveway. He passes the house and hidden gate opens at the far side of the property, looking like a piece of its stockade fence. The overgrown hedge creates a tunnel along the route you travel to a clearing. He parks outside an expansive single story building. It looks like a cross between a mountain cottage and a business. Tall windows framed with concrete supports along the back end, the front in wooden slats. From its position across the lake, it’s well hidden. If you chance to see it, you might think it was a resort or someone’s vacation home.


You hold Max and get out. A large mass of people come from the building after Gary announces your arrival from within the car and gets out to join you.
Many are robed, older ones in darker brown robes, while some are in brown and black suits. They come up but keep their distance; two of the elders come in closer. One goes to greet Gary; their exchange is like father and son. The other taller one graciously extends a greeting to you and The Nexus.


“We have searched for years only to find it here across the lake.” He laughs. Before he can continue, Gary interrupts and pleads his case. A few object to the idea of setting it free to return to its source, they want to control it. Their leader joins Gary’s side of the argument. You don’t like either idea, you want your cat to come home with you, but you want to do what’s right. The argument concludes in Gary’s favor. You join him in a precession to an open area that is laid out in a pattern of interconnecting circles.


There is a long meditative silence when everyone is seated in their proper place. You release the cat to the elder who greeted you and are allowed to sit next to Gary during the ceremony. He relaxes and starts to focus like he had in the car.
As the elder carries Max to the center, chanting starts, he says a few guttural phrases and Max appears to become luminescent and white. You are swept up with the energy now flowing through you, through them, from Max. At the peak of the chant you feel a phrase in your mind, and then everyone around you shouts it out.
“Boomshanko!”


A flash of light comes from the hands of the elder where Max is and he vanishes from the elder’s grasp. In the darkness everyone sits still for a little while, then get up and gather into groups and talk. You don’t bother. You’re sitting there missing Max in a whirl of confusing supernatural imagery, half wondering if this is all coming from Stan and Bud’s bottle of scotch.
Gary puts a reassuring hand on you, he tries to help you understand but you need time, and you want to go home.


In the morning you and Rory Toast MacStrudel have a conversation about last night. You miss Max even though the time was short. Rory dings and provides you with toast.
He’s so deep.
You swing around the laptop to get some work done and take your mind off of it when there’s a knock at the door.


You pull your robe together and open the door.


Gary is there with a black kitten that has amazing bright eyes. You look at him cautiously and he smiles. “No, we didn’t do it again, but fate has a way a dropping things in our lap. I found him on the way here, thought you might like him.”
He hands you the cat and leaves. Little Max has a little card strung to his little collar. The card is from Gary, his information and a number. On the back it simply says, ”Join us.”


You sit back down at the laptop. “Hmmm. A large group of guys to hang out with. A new cat. Well, if I can bring my trusty toaster, I just might have to consider it. Not sure if I could pull off the brown suit though, red maybe.”




The End?


But what happened to the steaks?? A bony hand reaches out suddenly and snatches them! –Oooooo!!</p>
</div>

<div id="chap110">
	<p> You grab your steaks and get in the car. The brown sedan takes off like a shot and you’re surprised how well the car moves, almost like you don’t have to steer at all!
But that’s because you’re drunk. You barely notice that sometimes you’re on the wrong side of the road and that your foot has the accelerator to the floor the whole time. 
What you do notice is that you’ve missed the library. You lazily turn. The car goes screeching across the intersection and straight into the giant Pengo-Ice ice cream stand. A collision with a giant fiberglass penguin and a brown sedan travelling at high speed is quite a spectacle. Propane tanks within rupture and ignite! The penguin explodes out from its belly and rips apart!


Hours later when the fire trucks put out the fire and pull the wreckage out from inside the remains of its innards, you and the steaks are barely recognizable from each other. Both are well done.


The End.</p>
